### Database
 - Intro
   - What is DBMS?
     - massive, persistent, safe, multi-user, convenient, efficient, reliable
   - Hadoop
     - processing software that process data on file
   - Key Concepts
     - model
       - description of how the data is modeled
       - general form of data going to be stored in the database
       - ex: set of records, xml, graph, 
     - schema vs data
       - schema; structure of database
     - DDL
       - use to set up a schema or structure of database
     - DML
       - querying and modifying 
   - Relational Model
     -  database = set of relations(tables)
     - each relation has set of named attributes (columns)
     - each tuple(row) has a value for each attribute
     - each attribute has type
     - Schema vs Instance
       - Schema: structure description of relations in database
       - Instance: actual content
     - NULL
     - Key
       - uniqe value in each tuple,
       - may be one attribute or maybe set of attributes
     - Creating Table
     - XML is one type of data model
   - Querying Relational Database
     - Design schema; create ddl
     - load data to db
     - execute query and modification
     - adhoc query in high level language
     - Query Language: DML 
     - query returns relation which may be combined again 
     - Query Language
       - relational algebra
       - sql
   - XML
     - basic construct
       - attribute
       - tag(maybe nested)  
       - text
     - tree format
     - in html tag means formatting data, but here in xml it means content of the data rather how format
     - xml vs databbase model
       - schema
       - structure
       - query
       - order
       - implement
     - Valid xml
       - specification:DTD(sorts of grammer that how the document will look like), XSD(almost same as dtd but written in xml format)
   - JSON
     - javascript object notation
     - standard for serializing  data objects usually in file
     - human readbale, useful for data exchagne
     - representing and registering semistructured data
     - Basic Constructs
       - Base values: number, string, boolean
       - object: {} (label: value)
       - arrays: []
     - recursive label - value pairs*
       - value might contain another label -value
     - we can use json schema to enforce certain structure/format beyond syntactical correctness


### OO Design
    - Class Diagram
      - Association vs Generalization
        - association: among objects/instances
          - aggregation: special type of association
          - part whole relationship***
            - ex: if i own a car, i won all of it's part
          - diamond sign
          - vehicle<>  ....* VehiclePart
          - when modeling initially we may have multiple parts but in real system we can aggregate them, we don't want to make new class for small changes
        - composition
          - special type/ strong kind of aggregation
          - if aggregate is destroyed then parts are destroyed also
          - diamond with filled
          - in composition we're saying that the data can be embedded in parent class but in vehicle class we don't want to do that because the part an be attached to another object 
        - generalization: inheritance
      - Propagation
        - not inheritance as inheritance built in but, propagation - 
        - need to code explicitly
        - maybe i have a method to the part class that has link to the whole not implicitly possessed
      - Inheritance
        - portion of visiable behavior of set of objects
          - similar to class, except lacks instance variables(may contain static variable), implemented methods
        - can be represent by lolipop symbol in class diagram, or <<interface>>
      - Object Constraint Language(OCL)
        - formally specify constraints in software modules
    - Model
      - System Domain Model
        - omits many classes 
      - System Model
        - system domain model + UI calsses + aritectural classes + utility classes
    - Suggested Sequences of Activity to find class diagram
      - find set of candidate classes (brainstorming) : look at the noun
        - some might be class and some might not be
      - add association and attributes
      - find generalization
      - list of main responsibilities of each class
        - operations
      - decide on specific operation
      - iterate the process
        - add or delete classes, associations, attributes, generalizations, responsibilities or operations
        - identify interface
        - apply design pattern
      - don't be unorganized and dont be too rigid
