### About 
 - This repository is a collection of my basic coding practices. In this repository, I have included almost all the basic codes (algorithm, data structure, interview-prep codes, OJ(uva, uri, leetcode, etc.)) that I have written so far besides making other small/big projects. All my interview preparation codes are also here. I also practiced coding on some Online Judge and included those codes in this repo. Few of my daywise works are also added here :P
