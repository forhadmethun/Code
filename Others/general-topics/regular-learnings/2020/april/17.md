Dear Quarantined Squad team,

Please see my comments to your workshop day 2 solutions.

Risk 3: "Data" is not defined as business asset in Table 1. Security requirement defined to mitigate security risk 4 is not modelled in Fig. 3. - x

Risk 4: Why Risk 4 is selected for modelling. This risk received score "low" in trade-off analysis. Why Risks with values "High" (e.g., Risk 7) are not selected? Explain/convince or re-model! - x

Risk 6: Security criteria is not defined in Table 1. BE CONSISTENT!!! Positioning data can't be System boundary because it is defined as business asset. System boundary represents system assets.

Risk 5: Security criteria is not defined in Table 1. Risk model is not consistent with definition. Violator is not defined, vulnerability is not present, see the rest of the definition.
Mal-activities allows modelling the security controls -- define what control (instead of security module) you are using.

BOTH SOLUTIONS MUST BE CONSISTENT!!!
