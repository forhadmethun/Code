# CCNA 2, Chapter 1: Routing Concepts
## Characteristics of Networkin
## Why Routing
## Router and 
 - Back panel of router
 - Router Memory
## Router Functions
### Router Interconnects Network
### Routers Choose Best Paths
 - static route, dynamic
 - router table
 - encapsulate packet
### Packet Forwarding
 - Process switching (oldest)
 - Fast Switching (slow)
   - next hop cached
 - CEF(fastest and more efficient)
## Connect to a Network
## Default Gateways
## Document Network Addressing
## Enable IP on a Host
 - Statically
 - DHCP
## Device LEDs
## Console Access
## Enabling IP on a switch
## Configure Router Basic Settings
## Configuring IPv4 Router Interface
## Configuring IPv6 Router Interface
## Configure an IPv4 Loopback Interface
## Verify Interface Settings
## Filter Show Command Output
## Command History 
# Routing Decisions

## Routing Decisions
## Best Path
 - Distance
 - Lowest metric
 - Protocol
   - RIP(hop count)
   - OSPF(cost based)
   - EIGPR(bw, delay, load, reliability)
## Load Balancing
## Administrative Distance
 - trustworthiness
 - the more the better
# Router Operation
## Routing Table
## Remote Network Route Entries
 - D: EIGRP
## Directly Connected Routing Table
## Static Routes
```
#in global config mode: 
ip route networkmask{next-hop-ip|exit-intf}
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Serial0/0/0#default route
show ip route | begin Gateway
ipv6 route ::/0 s0/0/0
show ipv6 route
```
## Dynamic Routing
## IPv6 Routing Protocols
 - RIPng
 - OSPFv3
 - EIGRP for IPv6
```
ipv6 router ? 
router
```

# CCNA 2, Chapter 2: Static Routing
## Static Route Implementation
## Reach Remote Networks
  - Manually
  - Dynamically
## Why Use static routing
## When to use static route
 - ease of routing table maintenance
 - stab route
 - a single default route to represent a path
## Static Route Applications
 - connect specific network
 - gateway of last resort of stab network
 - reduce # of routes
 - create backup route
## Standard Static Route
## Default Static Route
 - last resort to send packet, default static route is simply set to 0.0.0.0/0 as the destinition ipv4 address
## Summary Static Route
 - replace many networks with one summary network with anding or reducing some network bit 
## Floating Static Route
 - Configure a Backup Route
   - prefer to go via privatre link
   - if fails then can take backup route through internet

## Configuring Static and Default Routes
```
ip route network-address sunet-mask {next-hop-ip-address|exit-interface}
# configuring next hop static route
ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.2
# configuring directly connected static route
ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0/0
# configuring a fully specified static route
ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 s0/0/0 172.16.2.2
```
### Next-Hop Options
## Verify a Static Route
```
show ip route static | begin Gateway
show ip route 192.168.2.1
show running-config | section ip route
```
## Default Static Route

```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 {ip-address|exit-intf}
```
## IPv6 route command
### Next- Hop Options
 - next-hop static (next hop ip)
 - directly connected static(interface)
 - fully specified(both)
## Verify IPv6 route
## Default IPv6 Route
```
ipv6 route ::/0 {ipv6-address|exit-intf}
```
## Configure a Next-Hop Static Route
```
#need reverse lookup
```
## Floating Static Route
```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.2.2
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.10.2 5 #it will work as floating route, it will never work if the previous one is up 
```
## Test the IPv4 floating static route
```
show ip route # to verify if routing table using default static route
traceroute
#disconnect
show ip route #it should show backup route
traceroute # to follow traffic out to the backup route
```

## Automatically Installed Host routes
## Confugiring a host route
```
ip route 209.165.200.238 255.255.255.255 198.51.100.2
```
## Troubleshooting static and default routes
```
ping
traceroute
show ip route
show ip interface brief
show cdp neighbors detail
```
