### StringTokenizer class in java
    - StringTokenizer(String str)
    - StringTokenizer(String str, String delim)
    - StringTokenizer(String str, String delim, boolean flag)
      - If the flag is false, delimiter characters serve to  separate tokens. For example, if string is "hello geeks" and delimiter is " ", then tokens are "hello" and "geeks".
      - If the flag is true, delimiter characters are  considered to be tokens. For example, if string is "hello geeks" and delimiter is " ", then tokens are "hello", " "  and "geeks".

    - methods
      - hasMoreTokens()
      - nextToken()
    - learn pattern in java**
    - split method of string can take pattern and split by that pattern wise...
