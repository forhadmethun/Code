# Data Mining
 - mathematical methods (logistic, regression, neural network, segmentation classification, clustering)
 - extracting information   

## What is data
 - collection of objects defined by attributes(properties, behavior)
 - Attribute classification
   - discrete
   - continuous

## 1.1 Introduction
    - collect, clean, process, analyze, gain useful info
    - huge data is generated regular
      - www
      - atm
      - ui
      - sensors
    - data maybe unstructured -> need to convert to structured 
    - similar to mineral mining
    - challenging as different problems are different types
    - DM applications are connected to 4 super problem
      - pattern mining
      - clustering
      - classification
      - outline detection
## 1.2 Data Mining Process
    - Data Collection
    - Data Processing
      - feature extraction
      - data cleaning
      - feature selection and transformation
    - analytical processing & algo
## 1.3 Data Types
    - Nondependency oriented/ Multidimensional Data
        - eg. age, weight
      - Quantitative multidimensional(continuous)
      - categorical(discreet)
      - Binary & set data
      - Text data
    - Dependency Oriented
        - eg. social network
      - types
        - implicit
        - explicit
      - time series data
      - discrete sequence & strings
      - spatial data
      - network & graph data
## 1.4 Major Building blocks
    - Association Pattern Mining
      - defined context of sparse binary databases
    - Data clustering
      - data partition to sets so that each cluster becomes similar
    - Outline detection 
      - determine rows of data matrix that are very different from the remanining
    - Data classification
      - from training data create training model can be used to predict class label of record
## 1.5 Scalability Issue
## 1.6 Some Application Scenario
    - Store product placement
    - customer recommendation
    - medical diagnosis
    - web log anomalies

## Data Preparation
### Steps
    - Feature extraction and portability
      - domains
        - sensor data
        - image data
        - web logs
        - network traffic
        - document data
    - Data cleaning
    - Data reduction, selection & transformation

### Data Type Portability
    - Converting data between various data types
    - types
      - numeric to categorical
      - category to numeric
      - text to numeric
      - time series to discrete sequence
      - time series to numeric
      - discrete to numeric
      - spacial to numeric
      - graph to numeric
      - any type to graph

### Data Cleaning
    - handling missing entities
    - handling incorrect and inconsistent entities
    - scaling and normalization

### Data Reduction and Transformation
    - sampling
      - for static data
      - reservior sample
    - feature selection
      - unsupervised feature
        - removal of noisy and redundant attribute
      - supervised
        - relevant to data classfication, predict
    - data reduction with axis rotation
    - Data reduction with type transformation


## Similarity and Distances
### 3.1 Introduction
Given two objects O1 & O2, determine value of Similarity Sim(O1, O2) (or distance Dist(O1,O2)) between those objects.   
In similarity func, larger value implies greater similarity
In distance func, smaller value implies greater simmilarity

### 3.2 Multidimensional Data
#### Quantitative Data

```
# - > Minkowski Distance
Dist(x,y) = (E|x-y|^p)^(1/p)
p = 1, Manhattan
p = 2, Euclidean
```

SM -> Simple matching
SMC = # of matches / num of attributes
    = (m11 + m00)/(m01 + m10 + m11 + m00)
-> counts both presence and absence equally. used for objects with symmetric binary attributes. 
-> can be used to find students who answered similar in a test

JC -> Jaccard coefficients
J = (# of 11 matches) / (# of not-both-zero attribute values) 
  = (m11) / (m01 + m10 + m11)
-> handle objects with asymmetric binary attributes

Cosine Similarity
Extended Jaccard Coefficent(Tanimoto)
Correlation
    - linear relationship between objects [-1, 1]


## Clustering
 - grouping / groups of similar objects
 - partitioning data into subclasses absed on similarity
 - eg.
   - search engine
   - social network
   - genetics
   - marketing
 - types
   - 1. Centroid
     - k-mean
   - 2. connectivity
   - 3. distribution
   - 4. density based


## Classification
    - predicting something based on given input
    - systematic approach to build model from input
    - Mathematical techniques
      - decision tree
        - flow chart like tree structure
        - each node testing of an attribute value
        - branch represents outcome of test
        - leaves represents decision
      - linear tree
      - neural network
      - statistics
    - Algorithms
      - decision tree
      - rule based induction
