# Sorting
    - Counting
      - create countArray with maxElement of the given array
      - count
      - loop thorugh while countArray[i]>0 and put that element to array and decrease countArray[i] in loop
    - Bubble
      - for i = 0; i < n - 1
        - for j = 0; j < n - i - 1
    - quick
      - while(start < end){
        - p = findPivotIndex(arr, start, end)
        - qSort(arr, start, p - 1)
        - qSort(arr, p + 1, end  )
      - }
    - merge
      - while(start < end)
        - m 
        - mSort(arr, start, m)
        - mSort(arr, m + 1, end)
        - merge(arr, start, m, end)
    - heap
      - heap data structure
      - heapsort
        - heapify an array
        - replace the last with the first and reduce heap size and shiftDownInArray(0)

    - Greedy Method
      - optimization type problem
      - constraints/ conditions
        - feasible solutions are those solutions which are supporting constratins
      - from multiple feasible solutions find one optimal solution
      - minimization/ maximization
      - go through all the input and select best ways and include to the solution
      - problems:
        1. Knapsack
        2. job sequencing
        3. Optimal merge pattern
        4. Huffman Coding
            - Variable Size Encoding
            - Fixed Size Encoding
        5. Prims. Kruskal
        6. Dijkstra


    -* Optimization problem can be solved by 
        - greedy
        - dp
        - branch and bound
