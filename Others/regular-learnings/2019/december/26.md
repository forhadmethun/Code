### JAVA Syntax
 - Doublem.MIN_VALUE is a positive number
   - The IEEE 754 format has one bit reserved for the sign and the remaining bits representing the magnitude. This means that it is "symmetrical" around origo (as opposed to the Integer values, which have one more negative value). Thus the minimum value is simply the same as the maximum value, with the sign-bit changed, so yes, -Double.MAX_VALUE is the smallest possible actual number you can represent with a double.
