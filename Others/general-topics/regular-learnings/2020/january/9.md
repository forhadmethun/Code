### Big O
 - [Asymptotic Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOq5kSKqeR4)
     - execution time vary based on computer hardware(processor, other running programs taking more resources, etc.). So we can't measure in exact how many seconds a program take to execute
     - how fast runtime grows asymptotically means as the size of input increase infinity how the runtime change/grow
     - Ex: counting a string length, if we count character by character then O(len of string) or O(n) where n = lenght of the string but if we save the length in some space as string grows then each call of length() method will return the stored value which will be O(1). O(n^2) is greater than O(n) while O(logn) is more efficient than O(n)
     - best case(Omega), worst case(O), average case(when best case and worst case is same)
       - ex: for searching an element the element can be found in the starting of an array so best case is Omega(1) while it can be found at the end or not found either thus worst case is O(n). in the string length example earlier if the length is stored then for both best and worst case the time complexity is Omega(1) or O(1) so we can say theta(1)

    - It's not always a measure of speed but how a prgram scales 
      - Examples:
        - O(1) : adding an element to list
        - O(n) : searching
        - O(n^2) : bubble sort
        - O(nlogn) : merge sort
