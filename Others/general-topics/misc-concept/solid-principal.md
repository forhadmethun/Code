<i>Robert C.Martin(Uncle Bob) - `Design Principles and Design Patterns` 2000</i>

> intention is to make software design more understandable, easier to maintain & easier to extend.

### S - Single responsibility Principle
 - every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software

### 0 - Open / Closed Principle
 - Software entities(classes, modules, functions etc.) should be open for extensions, but closed for modification.
 - make sure that code is compliant with the open/closed principle by utilizing inheritance and/or implementing interfaces that enable classes to polymorphically substitution for each other.
### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
 - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
### I - Interface Segregation Principle
 - do not add additional functionality to an existing interface by adding new methods, instead create new interface and let class implement multiple interface if needed
### D - Dependency inversin principle
