#  CCNA - Introduction to Networks
## Chapter 2
### 2.0.1.1 Configure Network Operating System
 - like every computer, network devices(router, swtiches, access point, firewall) also need OS
 - Cisco internetwork operating system(Cisco IOS)
 - connection among devices(end, internal)
### 2.1.1.1
 - OS
   - hardware
   - kernel
   - software
 - Shell
   - CLI
   - GUI
 - IOS
   - CLI based
 - OS of home router is called firmware
 - easiest way to configure router is via web browser
 - all devices same OS
### 2.1.1.2
 - GuI
 - CLI
   - IOS is CLI based
 - possible to upgrade IOS version to obtain additional capabilities
### 2.1.2.1
 - IOS switch can be implemented without any config, if connect two pc then they can connect automatically 
 - Access Method
   - Console
     - outbound access
     - can be access without no networking service available
     - when configuring initially, connected with special cable
   - SSH
     - encrypted
     - each IOS include both server and client
   - Telnet
     - not encrypted
     - each IOS include both server and client
   - Aux port
     - some legacy network devices/routers can have 
     - access router with telephone connection
### 2.1.2.2
 - Terminal Emulation Programs
   - putty
   - tera term
   - secure crt
   - os x
### 2.1.3.1
 - To configure a swtich/router need a console connection initially
 - technician can execute command
 - packet tracer simulation
### 2.1.3.2 Primary Command mode
 - User Exec Mode
   - >
   - view only
 - Priviliged Exec Mode 
   - /#   
   - monitoring, config, management
### 2.1.3.3
 - by default user exec mode
 - enter `enable` command to enter into privilige mode
   - it will change from greater than to hash
 - `configure terminal` 
   - global configuration mode
 - `interface vlan 1` 
   - interface sub configuration mode
 - subconfiguration mode
   - line configuration mode
     - used to configure console, ssh, telnet, aux
     - `Switch(config-line)`
   - interface configuration mode
     - used to configure switch, port or router network 
     - `Switch(config-if)`
### 2.1.3.4 Basic IOS Command Structure
 - `Prompt Command Space Keyword/Argument`
   - Keyword
     - defined in OS
   - Argument
     - provided by user
     - like ip address
### 2.1.4.2
 - `description string`
 - `ping ip-address`
 - `traceroute ip-address`
### 2.1.4.3 IOS <<Help>> Feature
 - context sensitive
   - ?
   - if forget about syntax then start typing name and put ? and hit enter
   - if forget about argument then after the command name give space and press ? and hit enter
 - command syntax check
   - if any wrong command given 
   - where are we making error  ^- this place
   - if anything ambiguous
   - if any argument error
### 2.1.4.4 Hot Keys and Shortcuts
- tab
  - if unique command
  - if some char contains more than one command then ambiguous 
- backspace
- ctrl - d
- ctrl - k 
- ctrl w
- ctrl a
- up arrow, ctrl p
- right arrow, ctrl f
- --more--
  - enter
  - space
  - any key
- ctrl c
- ctrl z
- ctrl shift 6 : interrupt a command midstream
### 2.1.4.5 Hotkeys and Shortcuts
- command shortening
  - `int f 0/1`
- ctrl + r : redesplying, 
### 2.1.4.6 Navigating the IOS
# 2.2 Basic Device Configuration
## 2.2.1 Hostnames
### 2.2.1.1 Device Names
 - device need unique name
 - default name: Switch
 - choose name wisely
 - case insensitive
 - network documentation should define that how names are expressed
### 2.2.1.2 
 - switch name
 - `enable`
 - `configure terminal`
 - hostname router_name
 - if you need to reformat the name
   - `no hostname`
 - always update documentation
### 2.2.2.1 Secure Device Access
 - secure everything with strong password
### 2.2.2.2 Conigure Password
 - Secure privileged exec access
   - `enable secret password`
   - `exit`
   - `disable`
   - `enable`
 - Secure user exec access
   - `line console 0`
   - `password password`
   - `login`
   - `exit`
 - Vty line password
   - enable remote access
   - `line vty 0 15`
   - `password cisco`
   - `login`
### 2.2.2.3 Encrypt Password
 - `show running config`
 - `service password-encryption` : encrypt password
### 2.2.2.4 Banner Message
   - `banner motd msg`
### 2.2.2.5 All previous commands
### 2.2.3.1 Save Running Config
 - `show running-config`
 - To save changes made to the running config to startup config
   - `copy running-config startup-config`
   - `copy run start`
 - two system files that store device config
   - startup-config
     - nvram
     - `show startup-config`
   - running-config
     - ram
     - modifying a running config affects the operation of cisco device immediately
     - volatile
     - `show running-config`

### 2.2.3.2 Alter the Running Config
 - in `running-config` mode we want to alter something then just do it
 - `reload` command to it's previous config
 - device will be offline breif amoutn of time
 - to discard chagne enter `n` or `no`
 - to remove startup config use `erase startup-config` in priviliged exec mode, it will remove startup config from nvram, `reload` device,  will load default startup configuration that shipped from 
 - `dir ?`
 - `dir nvram:`
 - `copy run start`
 - `copy start run`
   - to discard the latest change on volatile ram to last change
 - `reload`
### 2.2.3.3 Capture Config to a Text File
 - Logging
   - Putty > Session > Logging > All Session output > Filename
 - No Logging
   - Putty > Session > Logging > None
 - the text file created can be used as a record of how the device is currently implemented
 - to restore config of a device
   - enter golab config mode
   - copy and paste the text file into terminal window connected to the switch
### 2.3.1.1
 - devices need ip address
 - ipv4
   - dotted decimal notation
   - represented by 4 decimal numbers between 0 to 255
   - all devices connected to internet are assigned an ipv4 address
   - IP : internet protocl
     - ipv4 & ipv6
   - with ipv4 address, a subnet mask also necessary, 32 bit value that seperates the network portion of the address from the host portion, coupled with the ipv4 address
   - subnet mask determines which particular subnet the device is a member
 - default gateway
   - is the ip address of the router that the host will use to access remote network
 - ip address canbe assigned to both physical ports and virtual interfaces on devices
### 2.3.1.2 Interfaces and Ports
 - 
### 2.3.2.3 Swithc Viertual Interface Concig
 - To access switch remotely an IP address & submet mask must be configured
 - `interface vlan 1`
 - `ip address ip-address submet-mask`
 - `no shutdown`
 - `show run`
 - `show ip interface brief`
 - 
### 2.3.3.2
 - `ping`
### 2.3.
