### Database
- Schema
  - organization of data how database is constructed(divided into database tables in case of relational database)
  - formal definition: schema is set of constraints(sentences) called integrity constraints
  - can contain formulus representing integrity constraints
  - in rdbms schema defines: tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queue, trigger, type, sequences bla bla bla


### Software Engineering - OOP Design
- [Chapter 3 (Part 1) - Reuse, Frameworks, and Basic Client-Server Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7kLteC0vJY&list=PLJ9pm_Rc9HesnkwKlal_buSIHA-jTZMpO&index=4)
  - Interface
    - is like abstract class but
      - we can't create create any instance of interface like interface
      - cannot have any concrete method
      - we can implement multiple interface
      - can create variable of interface type which can operate on the abstract method declared on that interface
  - Packaging and importing
    - package combines related class into subsystems
      - all class in particular directory
    - class in different package can have same name
      - although not recommended
  - Access control
    - public, protected, default, private
  - API
    - set of methods can be called by the outside world
    - framework provide services called Api
    - in OOP API is defined by set of public methods of these classes
  - Thread and concurrency
    - Thread: Sequence of instruction can be running concurrently with other threads
    - run() method is like main() method in thread program
    - if the run() method ends then the thread exist, if we want to run again and again then use loop
    - after creating thread object, call start() method to start the thread, it automatically call the run() method 
  - Programming Style guidelines    
    - commenting
    - naming
    - avoid cloing, create method where necessary
      - cloning can create multiple bugs
    - organize class elements consistently
    - layout
    - adhere object oriented principle
    - prefer private
    - don't mix user interface related to code with computation code
  - Keep the risk in mind
    - slow language - java
    - deprecated syntax
  - Wanna be a good engineer?
    - reuse as much as you can
      - reuse knowledge
      - reuse buitin concepts
      - reuse what have already built
  - framework
    - a whole set of piece of system/ reusable software/ reusable piece of software that have enough functionality to be called a complete application but almost there/ implements generic solution to generalize problem
    - give details to make an application / provides common facilities to different application program
    - principle: applications might be different but related things can have quite similiar design
    - types:
      - horizontal
      - vertical
  - Client Server Architecture
    - is an example of distributed architecture
    - distributed system:
      - multiple computers communicate with each other and software system id distributed among those computers
    - sequence diagram
    - example:
      - www
      - mail
      - network file system
      - remote display
      - database
    - each software might act as both server and client then the network is peer to peer network
    - state diagram
    - activity diagram
    - Thin client(most work done in server) vs Fat Client system(most work on client(game))
    - Communication Server
      - maybe symmetric or asymmetric(different language: get/post vs html)
    - Technology need to build the system
      - IP
        - route messages from one computer to another
        - long messages are splitted into chuncks
      - TCP
        - handling things in high level
        - built top of IP
        - job is to handle the connection
      - TCP/IP 
        - each device has ip address
        - name
        - ip and port number needed 
      - Establishing Connection in Java
        - java.net package
          - permits creating tcp/ip connection between application
          - Socket
            - maitain communication among the end of the connection/both tunnel(server & client)
            - normal communication
          - ServerSocket
            - waits for the connection request come in server
                ```java
                    //in server side
                    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port); 
                    Socket clientSocketInServerSide = serverSocket.accept(); 

                    //in client side
                    Socket clientSocketInClientSide = new Socket(host, port); 
                ```
        - Exchanging information in Java
          - java.io 
          - InputStream to receive message
          - OutputStream to send message
            ```java
            output = clientSocketInClientSide.getOuputStream(); //will write to server through this
            input = clientSocketInClientSide.getInputStream(); // will read data from server through this

            //without filters : raw bytes
            output.write(msg);
            msg = input.read();

            output.writeDouble(msg);
            msg = input.readDouble();


            output.writeObject(msg);
            msg = input.readObject();

            ```
