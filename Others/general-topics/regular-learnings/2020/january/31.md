### CTCI
 - Intro VI - VIII
   - VI - Big O
     - efficiency of algorithm
     - too important to develop algrithm
       - ex 1: transfer file to friend
         - if small then send electronically, O(s)
         - if 1TB then transfer via plane or drive if want to transfer fast, O(1)
       - ex 2: need to paint a plane with width w, height h then it's O(wh) if there is p plane, then O(whp)
     - O
       - upper bound
       - print all array elements, O(N) and it could be described as O(N^2), O(N^3), O(2^N)
         - so printing all elements take O(N) as well as O(N^3) or any runtime bigger than O(N)
       - <= relationship
       - age <= 130 so truye for age <= 200, age <= 2000
            ```
            f(n) = O(g(n)) where exists n0 < n & c and, 
            f(n) <= c * g(n) 

            ex: 
                verify is, f(n) = 4n^2 + 16n + 2 
                is, f(n) => O(n^4)  ?

                so, 
                    4n^2 + 16n + 2 <= c * (n^4)

                    if n = 1, 2, 3 then the equation would be false
                    but from, n = 4 to onwards the equation is always correct 
                    so for this equation n0 = 4
                ans:
                    YES
            ```
     - Omega
       - lower bound
       - Omega(N) means Omega(log N) and Omega(1) as it won't be faster than those  
            ```
            f(n) = Omega(g(n)) where exists n0 < n & c and, 
            f(n) >= c * g(n) 

            ex: 
                verify is, f(n) = 4n^2 + 16n + 2 
                is, f(n) => O(n^3)  ?

                so, 
                    4n^2 + 16n + 2 <= c * (n^3)
                    => not possible
                ans:
                    NO
            ```
     - Theta
       - tight bound
            ```
            f(n) = Theta(g(n)) where exists n0 < n & c1, c2 and, 
            c1 g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n) 

            ex: 
                verify is, f(n) = 4n^2 + 16n + 2 
                is, f(n) => O(n^2)  ?

                so, 
                    
                ans:
                    Yes


            lets,
            T(n) = 4n^2 + 16n + 2 => some program has nested loop and an operation to loop through all elements 16 times and some computation with 2 cost
            
            if then n incrase then the dominating term will be 4n^2 maybe 99.99%
            so we can say, T(n) would be less than theta(n^2) may be 5(n^2) or some other constant

            ```
     - Industry merge O & theta so O(N) is not O(N^2)
     - best, worst, expected cases are different from upper, lower, tight bound
       - eariler ones related to O and  theta 
     - Space Complexity
       - recursive sum(n) take O(n) space
       - which instruction runs faster, we need to go machine level to compute but we won't do that, we'll drop constant's and related terms
       - we cannot reduce O(B^2 + A) without getting special knowledge about A, B
       - O(2^N * N^N) >  O(N^N) > O(N!) > A(2^N) > A(N^2) > O(NlogN) > O(N) > O(logN) > O(1)
     - Amortize Analysis
       - for resizable array how to cmpute the time complexity
       - x + x/2 + x/4 + ... => O(2X) is insertion O(1)
     - O(log N) => Binary Search, BST
     - O(2^N) => fibonacci
     - for logarithmic base doesn't matter but for exponent base is important as 2^n & 8^n differ by 2^2n which is huge
     - O(branches ^ depth)
     - ex:
       - O(n)
       - O(n^2)
       - O(n(n-1)) => O(n^2)
       - O(ab)
       - O(1000ab) => O(ab)
       - O(n/2) => O(n)
       - O(n + m) => cannot be sure as don't know anything about m
       - O(a * s log s + s * a * log a) => s, string size & a, array size
       - O(2^log N) => O(N)
       - O(N) for factorial
       - O(sqrt(N)) for prime
       - *O(N^2 * N!)for permutation
       - O(2^N) for fibonacci
       - *O(2^N) all fibonacci => 2 ^ 1 + 2 ^2 + 2 ^3 => O(2^(N+1))
       - O(N) => memoized dp fibonacci
       - O(log N) => power of 2
       - O(a/b) => division algorithm
       - O(digits of numbers) => O(log n) => 10^d = n
       - *O(Kc^K) => number of sorted string of size k, where is is the number of characters
   - VII - Technical Question
     - solve prblem by own, code on paper, test on paper, test on pc
     - power of 2 table 
       - 2^16 => 64k
       - 2^10 => 1k
       - 2^30 => 1GB
       - 2^32 => 4GB
       - 2^7 => 127
     - i) walking through problem
       - understand the problem
       - listen + example + brute force + example + walk through -> implement -> test
       - listen carefully
         - sorted array then must be some optimization
         - repeaded task so there must be some caching type of thing or precomputation
     - ii) draw example diagram
     - iii) ** state brute force
       - it's expected that initial solution won't be optimal
       - some may not state brute force as it seems obvious. BUT IT IS NOT OBVIOUS FOR ALL CANDIDATE & INTERVIEWER WOULD THINK THAT I'M NOT CAPABLE OF CREATING EASY SOLUTION
       - initial solution might be terrible,state time & space complexity & improvements can be possible
       - the solution might be slow but good start point
     - iv) Optimize
       - look unused info: is array sorted?
       - fresh example: find pattern
       - solve incrrectly then fix
       - time vs space trade off
       - precompute*
       - hash table* : should be top of your mind!!
     - v) walk through
       - basic code steps, no need pseudocode 
     - vi) implement
       - now i have optimal algo and know what i need to do so need to go ahead and implement
       - give line gap between line in white board coding
       - beautiful code:   
         - modularize code: method which give some thing
         - error checks: todo
         - use classes: points
         - good variable name
       - refactor code when necessary 
       - if confusion arise then go back to walk through process
     - vii) Test
       - ** important
       - approach
         - try explaining : conceptual test
         - double check conditions
         - exception double check: division by zero, null in set, array, etc.
         - small test cases: maybe small size array
         - speial case check: pass null, single, extreme cases, other special cases
     - BUD Approach
       - Bottlenecks
         - if a program contains O(nlogn) & O(logn) both then reducing O(log n) won't help as bottleneck is O(nlogn)
         - ** if chuncks of codes done repeatedly then reduce O(n) to O(logn) even O(1)
         - find all difference k of two elements from a list    
           - O(n^2) loop possible
           - O(nlog n) => sorting then binary search
           - o(n) => hash map
       - Unnecessary Work
         - find a^3 + b ^3 = c ^3 + d ^3 for 1 to 1000
         - O(n^4) then O(n^3) then O(n^2)=> by hashmap
         - try to optimize loop using map or other DS techniques if possible
       - Duplicate Work
         - try avoiding same computation multiple time
     - DIY
       - use practical knowledge, how you find any word on dictionary
       - intuition
       - design algorithm
       - find the permutations of s in different position of string b   
         - generating all permutation then checking will take O(S! * b)
         - depending on algorithm the solution can be optimized 
     - Simplify & Generalize    
       - generalize word as character then compute things for character then think what the computation would be if we use word instead of character
     - Base Case and Build
       - find permutation of string
     - Data Structure Brainstorm
       - Array? Linked List? Tree ? Set ? HashMap? etc.?
     - BCR
       - best conceivable Runtime
       - if we have an array of size n then BCR must be at lest O(n) if we need  to traverse all the elements
       - two sorted array find the common elements
         - BCR => O(n)
         - if we run nested loop then o(n^2)
         - if we use a loop and binary search then o(nlog n)
         - if we use hash map then o(n) but need extra space
         - if we write algorithm like merging two sorted array then => O(n) without any extra space
         - so BCR helps!!!
