* How DNS Works
  - [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpQZVYPuDGU)
  - In the computer worlds each device know each other by numbers such as ip address
  - In the human world we know each other by names
  - To bridge between the two world network engineers created DNS
  - DNS resolves name to numbers
    - resolves domain names to ip address
  - DNS basically works like a phone book. When you search for a number you don't memorize the number. you look for the name first which will give you the number   
  - Steps DNS Follow
    1. Browser, OS
    2. If don't found by the previous stage cache memory then query goes to the next level called resolver searver
       - basically isp, which searches it's own cache
    3. If not found by the upper step then the quer y is sent to the next level called root server
        - top, root of the DNS hierarchy
        - 13 sets of root servers
          - each set has own unique ip address
        - operated by 12 org.
        - root server doesn't know what's the ip address is but knows that where to find the ip address
        - root server then direct the resolver to the tld server
        - so resolver will ask the tld for the ip address now
        - TLD
          - stores address info for top level domains such as .com, .org
          - so when request come for 'yahoo.com', TLD doesn't know what's the ip address for ip address.com but it will reply the resolver with the final level authoritative name servers
          - so finally the authoritative name server will retrun the ip address of 'yahoo.com' to the resolver
          - Authoritative Name Server
            - knows everything about domain
              - ip address
          - resolver will cache 



# Networking - CCNA 1
## Throughput
 - Throughput
 - Latency
 - Goodput
## Types of Physical Media
 - produces representation and grouping of bits in voltage, frequencies or ligh pulses
 - specifications
## Caracteristcis of Copper Cabling
## Copper Media
 - 3 types
   - UTP
   - STP
   - Coaxial
## Unsheilded Twisted Pair Cable
 - interconnect host with intermediate device
 - twisted to remove interference
 - 4 pairs
   - color identify different part
 - use RJ-45 connector
## Sheilded Twisted Pair Cable
 - better noise protection, more expensive, difficult to install
