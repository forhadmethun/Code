### OOSE
 - Idenfitying Generalizations
   - bottom-up approach
     - from common name,address find class name
   - top-down approach
     - start with the class then we'll find out different subclasses
     - be careful, maybe we don't need any class at all
 - when interface?
   - generalization(parent-child/subclass) relation is necessary when there is 'is-a-relation' exist. but if we need to specify some operation but there is no 'is-a-relation' then we may create interface
 - responsibilities
   - something that the system required to do
   - operations
   - functional requirement attributed to classes
     - responsibility of a class need to be related
     - too much responsibility means there need new class
     - no responsibility means there need no class
     - if any of the existing classes cannot be able to attribute responsiblity then need to create new class
   - How to determine responsibility?
