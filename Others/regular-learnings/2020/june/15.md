## Build Web Service With Spring
### Week 1
 - URLs & Query Param
   - http://host:port/path?a=b
     - urlencode 
       - if any key/value contains spcial character like =, ? etc then need to encode   
 - Mime Type & Content Type Headers
   - Mime Type
     - special type /format of data which describes the body
     - image/jpeg, image/png, text/plain, text/html
   - Content Type
     - describe Mime Type
   - Request Body Encoding
     - request message
       - body
         - url encoded
           - key/value
         - multiaprt
           - large amount of data break down

- HTTP Response
  - status Line
    - status code + phrase/text
    - Headers
      - Content-Type
    - Body
- Respose Code
  - 1xx - info
  - 2xx - success
    - 200 - ok
  - 3xx - redirect
  - 4xx - client error
    - 404 - resource not found
  - 5xx - server error
  - write logic to handel response based on response code
- Cookie
  - server sends to the client to remember small piece of data and send to the server..
  - client extract response header and save the necessary data to the local storage
  - has an expiration data
- Protocol Layering & HTTP Design Methodologies
  - VideoService(our protocol) -> HTTP -> TCP
  - WebServices(WSDL, SOAP) -> HTTP -> TCP
  - REST -> HTTP -> TCP
  - So, Webservices, REST are methodologies for building on top of the http that describes very specific frmats and principles that we use when we're building things on http
- HTTP Polling
  - simply http is one way
  - if multiple client then how server send data if required to client side
  - one way is client refreshing, while client wants can ppull the screen/click some button to refresh from the server
  - polling
    - in every T timer interval client send request to the server again and again
    - resource consumption from the server
    - the timer can be designed, firstly T if thre is no update then 2T interval etc.
  - WebSocket
    - client request to server to establish a websocket
    - once established either party can send data to other  
    - if client loose the websocket connection need to reconnect from the client side
    - we can write service on the top of websocket to get efficient 
    - websocket can be overhead for server as need to create a connection for a client
  - REST
    - what generally people thinks - you build up your resource URLs in the particular format that I think of as REST
    - what people think of
      - /video                  --> all videos (if we want to get, then GET request)
      - /video/1                --> speicific videos(if we want to create/updaet then put)
      - /vide/1/duration        --> a part of video
    - Using http verb(GET, POST, PUT) to access/modify/operate on resources
  - Push Messaging
    - android/client is connected to Google Cloud Messaging server via xmpp through a registration id which can be send to my server, then my server can send request directy to the GCM
    - the bottelneck of GCM is that we can't send more than 4kb data, so what we do, we send notification to the client via GCM and client sync data thorugh our server





### Week 2
 - What are Servelets?
   - WebContainer
     - contains java object with methods which are servlets
       - doGet
       - doPost
     - there is some sorts of routing to handle which servlet to use, web.xml
 - Cloud Service with Servlet
```
void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HtttpServletResponse resp){
    //extract params
    //error checking
    //convertion
    //so logic
}
//http -> java->correction values-> convertion-> logic
//we don't want to do the frist steps and just wanna focus on logic
```
 - Request Routing and Web.xml
   - web-app
     - servlet
       - name
       - class
     - servlet-mapping
       - name
       - pattern
 - validation in server side is always mandatory
 - Security Handling Client Data and Avoid Injection Attack
   - client can send malicious javascript which can execute later 
 - How Mobile Device can communicate with server
   - through http
     - send video or text/ get response
 - Spring Dispatcher Servlet and Controller Abstraction
   - Spring has dispatchr servlet that removes the  hassle of parsing, error handling, constructing objct
   - Spring provides specialized servlet named Dispatcher servlet that maintains one or more Controllers
 - Intro to Spring to Spring Controller 
   - Class can have annotation Controller
   - method can have annotation @RequestMapping
   - those annotation tells the Dispatcher Servlet where to map the request
 - Accepting Client Data with RequestParam Annotations
   - @RequestParam maps the parameter to the variable in the method
 - Accepting Client Data with PathVariable Annotations
   - @RequestMapping("/search/{id}")
     - inside the method @PathVariable("id")
 - Accepting Client Data with Request Body Annotations & JSON
   - if we want to map some client data to some java object
   - @RequestBody
   - Automatic Data marshaling, There is something named http message converter that converts te client data to some object and pass to method parameter
 - Handling Multipart Data
   - we'll use multipart format 
   - @RequestParam("data") Multipart videoData
   - Inside method, InputStream inputStream = videoData.getInputStream()
 - It can be configured by spring as well   
   - write a method that return multipart config element, it should be annotated by @Bean
 - Generating Responses with the ResponseBody Annotation
   - @ResponseBody annotation before method
 - Custom Marshalling with Jackson Annotations
   - Jackson open source and taken by spring which map from json to object and vise versa
 - Spring Boot & Application Structure
   - If we need to set Spring framework: web container(apache tomcat, jetty) inside this we need dispatcher servlet that maps controllers 
   - we can use springboo that automates all those things
   - Application Structure
     - We have set of Controllers and a main Class Application.java that contains everything associated with the controller and configuratiation and contains main method
       - 1. setup web container
       - 2. discover controller
       - 3. setup dispatcher
       - 4. configuration, ex- connect db
- Horizaontal Scaling
- Load Balancing Stateless vs. Stateful Applications
  - Sticky Session
    - route same client to same machine
  - can use external storage to store session or related info
- Auto Scaling
  - Idea of adding server capacity automatically and turn then off if not needed
  - when to make some machine online or offlien
  - failover can be handled by the scaling property
- IaaS & PaaS
  - Infrastracture 
    - I'm tha maintainer for everything, security , scaling
    - AWS
  -  Platform
    - provide functionality
    - Google App Engine
- Offloading to Cloud Provider Services
  - when to give provider money
    - do yourself
        - cost
    - provider
      - cheaper
      - cdn
      - database
        - dynamodb
      - cloud storage
        - s3
    - Spring Framework provide high level abstruction to use those services, we can use multiple services
