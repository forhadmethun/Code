I have tried to go through many materials and decided to keep track of those. So I'm creating this file so that I can review it later while needed. Some of the resources are just for helping me to understand different concepts which are beyond preparation material. 
I mostly followed [coding-interview-university](https://github.com/transparent2/coding-interview-university) originally forked from [this link](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). 
## Mostly Necessary material to prepare for top tech companies
  - Basic Data Structure and Algorithm( you can't learn all and then start coding so just learn the basics from the material provided in this page and meantime start solving problems from OJ)
  - Solve problem from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [interviewbit](http://interviewbit.com/)
  - Follow CTCI

## Basic Core Concepts
How Computer works? Is it a magic? - Not really. Go through the playlist you'll get more insight. [Crashcourse - CS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)
### Operating System
  [Learn how Operating System works.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL--jIyXjDXf6Q4XA6q8RYnyChYzJ0K0F2 ) \
  Learn:  processes, threads, synchronization, file system, network, cloud, distributed system etc.
### Computer Networking
  - [Learn Basic Networking Concepts] 
    - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro)
    - learn about OSI, TCP/ UDP, Subnetting
### Database
  - [my practice resource](https://github.com/forhadmethun/Code/blob/master/Others/general-topics/programming-syntax/basic-sql.md)
  - know difference about SQl & NoSQL
  - Join Operations
  - Solve few common problems related to SQL

## Programming Language
In my undergraduate there was courses of python, C/C++, Java and even I practiced different problem solving problems(from OJs) in C/C++ but after graduation I worked mostly with Java and it's OOP (though C++ also OOP :P) so I choose Java for solving problems and practice. Language is nothing. Basic concepts(variable, loop, condition, array, string, etc.) are the main point to learn. If you know the basic concepts then learning a programming language is child's play. Just learn a language and start solving problems. I think the more problem you solve(from OJ, leetcode, interviebit, etc.) the more chances you have to get hired.
