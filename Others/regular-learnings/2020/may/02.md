### Static Routing Uses
### Static Routing Advantages and Disadvantages

## RIPv2
```
conf t
router rip
network ip-address-to-advertise
show ip protocols
show ip route | begin Gateway
```
```
router rip
version 2
```

## Disable Auto Summarization
```
no auto-summary #to modify default RIPv2 behavior of automatic summarization
show ip protocols
```
## Configuring Passive Interfaces
```
router rip
passive-interface g0/0
end
show ip protocols | begin Default
```
## Propogate a Default Route
```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/1 209.146.200
router rip
default-information originate
shw ip route | begin Gateway
```
## The Routing Table
```
show ip route | begin Gateway
```
## Directly Connected Entries
## Remote Network Entries
## Routing Table Terms
 - ultimate
 - level 1 route
 - level 1 parent route
 - level 2 child routes
## Ultimate Route
 - either next hop or exit
 - all route except parent route
 - parent's route are subnetted
 - any route with parent route level but not subnetted is level one

## level 1 route
 - network
 - supernet
 - default

## level 1 parent route
## level 2 child route
## Router Lookup Process
 - best route = longest match
## IPv6 Routing Table Entries
 - all routes are level 1 ultimate routes
