  - Software?
     - Intangible 
       - cannot be touched like tv, radio , bridge
       - software engineering is different
       - some software may have millions of line of code so complex
      - easy to reproduce
        - cost is in development
      - industry is labour intensive
        - hard to automate
      - 60 bllion dollars wasted money in software industry which can be minimized by got practice of development
  - types of software
    - custom
    - generic
    - embedded
    - real time software
    - data processing software
  - software engineering
    - process of solving customer's problem
    - systemetic development and evolution of large, high-quality, software system
    - within cost, time and other constraints

    - solving customer's problem
    - systemetic development and evolution
      - standards
        - well accpeted practices standardize
          - IEEE, ISO
    - large, high quality software systems
      - bridge, house need engineering same for software also
      - large people need project management 
    - cost, time, other constraints
  - Software Engineering and Engineering Profession
    - the term coined 1968
    - engineering is licensed profession
  - Stakeholders of Software Engineering
    - users
    - customers
    - software developers
    - development managers
  - Software Quality
    - Usability
    - Efficiency
    - Reliability
    - Maintainability
    - Reusability


    - all of the above is trade off - different qualities can conflict
    - software engineers need to set objective that what they want
    - optimization is necessary sometimes
    - Interal quality criterial
      - have effect on external quality
        - commenting code
        - complexity code
  - Software Engineering projectss
    - green field
    - building frameworks - reusable code, library 
      - you have to add modules/ compoenets to work as a fully functional 
  - Activities common to software project
    - requirements and specification
    - design
      - how the requirements should be implemented
      - includes;
        - system engineering
        - software architecture
        - detailed desing of subsystems
        - ui
        - db
    - Modeling
    - Programming
    - Quality Assurance
    - Deployment
    - Managing Process
- [Chapter 2 -  Basic of Object Orientation] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noe17Sg5Uas&list=PLJ9pm_Rc9HesnkwKlal_buSIHA-jTZMpO&index=3&t=0s)
  - What is Object Orientation
    - Procedural Paradigm   
      - functions, routines, methods
      - we write code inside precudure, it execute and return some value, 
      - we don't care much about the inside so here is some abstraction that give some output according with some input
      - precudre works fine for simple data like int, float, string etc. but day by day data become complex 
      - so records came into play, like in COBOL. structs in C. and they are used in the context of precedural paradigm
        - it also become mess as procedure are operating on data from different places of program 
        - so accessing or modifying data from all over the place
        - so, you start with nice program, sub program, sub sub program which are easy to understand but became a mess of access data from all over the place
      - so switch and organized programs around the data and that was the concept of class
    - OOP
      - Organized programs where classes each representing some data and procedures are put into the classes instead of around data modified by procedures now precedure inside classes which organizes and still maintainable and understandable 
    - OO paradigm
      - an approach to the solution of problems in which all computations are performed in the context of objects
      - objects are instances of classes, data abstractions and more sophisticated version of routine/ structs
      - classes themselves use procedural abstractions that operates on obejcts
      - we can think program collections of objects where all doing their own thing
    - Classes and Objects   
      - Objects
        - Chunck of structured data in  a running software system
        - Property of object
          - has properties
            - represents it states
          - has behavior
            - how it acts and reacts
            - the methods
            - many simulate the behavior in real world
        - in UML defined by underline and colon to differentiate between class and object
      - Class
        - a unit of abstraction in object oriented design
        - represent similiar object
          - instances
        - is a kind of software module
          - describes instance's structure(properties)
          - their behavior(method)
      - examples of classes and objects
      - namig classes
        - capital
        - singular
        - right level of generality
          - municipality not city
        - only one meaning
        - name after 'Noun'
    - Variable
      - In procedural
        - local
        - global
      - In Objecct Oriented
        - class variable/ static variable
          - shared by all instances of a class
          - if one instance change the value then all other instancec get the changed value
          - shouldn't use that much
          - useful for
            - default or constant
            - lookup table or similiar structure - common computation for all 
        - caution: don't use static variable
        - instance variable
          - defined inside a class corresponding to data present in each instancce
            - attributes
              - simple data, int float etc.
            - association
              - relationship between two class
                - ex: course is taken by students
    - Variable vs Object
      - Variable
        - refer to an object
        - may refer different object in different time
        - variable is pointing some memory(object)
      - an object can be referred by different variable at the same time
      - types of variable
        - determines what class of object it may contain
        - loose type: 
        - strong type: java, c++
    - Operations
      - high level procedural abstraction that specifies type of behavior
      - independent of code which implements that behavior
      - ex: calculating area (in general): as there  might be area for circle, rectangle etc.
    - Method
      - procedural abstraction used to imlement behavior of a class
      - different class have method with same name
    - Polimorphism
      - a property of object oriented software by which an abstract operation may be performed in different ways in different class
      - one of the key concept of OOP, if no polimorphism then not a OOP
      
      - multiple method with same name
        - conceptually do the same thing with multiple algorithms, 
          - the choice which one to execute depends at runtime with which class of object is given variable
      - if only one class then there is no needto have polimorphism
      - so polimorphism kicks in when there is actually hierarchy and have bunches of sub classes of a super class and you don't know which of the subclasse's to show up in a given variable. so at runtime system has to check and see what class object is in the variable and then choose the appropriate variable to run at runtime
        - ex: if circle then run circle version, if triangle the run the triangle version 
      - benefit: don't have to write if, ex: if circle do this, if triangle do this, or swtich case
    - Organizing class into inheritance and Hierarchy
      - Superclass 
      - Inheritance Hierarchies
      - Inheritance 
      - Creating Subclass
        - Is A rule 
          - create subclass : always check generalization to ensure they obey is a rule
          - ex: checking account is an account
          - ex: village is a municipality
          - ex: (not) proviance a country?
        - all inherited feature make sense
    - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Variable
      - Abstract class
        - there is no point to create an instance of the class we'll create object of it's some subclass where all the computation is done
        - two purpose to create abstract class
          - can create a variable and put any of it's subclass
          - gather us everthing which is common to it's subclass
          - what's the meaning of abstract method?
            - somewhere down below there is concrete implementation of the class
        - In UML abstract class is represented by italics
      - example: shape2d class with subclasses



- [Chapter 2 (Part 2) - Inheritance, polymorphism and review of key Java concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSJ0zNQ2Ilk&list=PLJ9pm_Rc9HesnkwKlal_buSIHA-jTZMpO&index=3)
  - Abstract class
    - cannot create object as no impleentation of methods
    - somewhere any subclass must have concrete implementation given that a superclass has an abstract operation 
      - leaf class must have or inherit concrete methods for all operations 
      - leaf class must be concrete
    - superclass variable can hold object of subclass
    - if any operation make sense to the higher level then put the operation to the higher level
    - if single operation in a class is abstract then the class must be abstract
    - opposite of abstract class is concrete class
  - Overriding
    - a method would be  inherited but any subclass contains a newer version instead
    - when to use overriding?
      - restriction
      - extension
      - optimization
  - Immutable Object
    - we won't change an object once created if any method is changing something then return new object, ex: String class in java
  - How to decide which method to run? ( abstract way )
    - if current class has concrete method then return
    - look superclass one by one
    - if found return
    - else through error  
        ``` 
        Shape2D rectangle = new Rectangle();

        ```
  - Dynamic binding
    - the concept basically flows from the concept of polimorphism and inheritance
    - it's the process of the last algorithm(see up)
    - the process is dynamically deciding/checking which method to run
    - * occurs when decision about which method to run can only be made at runtime
    - needed when?
      - varable is declared to have superclass as its type not some leaf class, that has some actual class below it
        - if we declare variable with leaf class then we are sure that which method will run as only one possiblity
        - but if we declare variable with some superclass in hierarchy then there might be different classes of object in that variable and that point we don't quite know what's gonna actually run
      - there is more than one possible polimorphic methods that could run among the variable and its subclasses
  - Concepts to Define OOP
    - identity
      - each object is distinct from each other
      - even if the same data two object differs
    - class
    - inheritance
    - polymorphism
  - Other Key concepts
    - abstraction
      - is something to look at something without having to see all the details which is simpler higher level view
      - representation of something which is more concrete
      - fundamental of all computing
      - superclass is abstraction of subclasses
      - class is abstraction of set of objects
      - abstract class is some abstraction where any subclass will have concrete implementation
      - interface is more abstract view
        - interface is explicitly saying hey we're going to define set of operation we're not going to give any concrete implementation 
      - Object -> something in real world
      - class -> object
      - superclass -> subclass
      - operation -> method
      - attribute and associations -> variables
    - modularity
      - methods inside class
      - package in java
    - encapsulation
      - hiding information
      - we don't need to know detailed information about any method or any operation
      - closely related to abstraction 
  - No need to meorize methods, study java doc to learn about library
    - gives abstract view wihtout deeper understand
  - Java Review
    - Character, char, String
    - Arrays, Collection, Vector, ArrayList, Iterator
    - Casting
      - java strict about types
    - Exception
      - anything that can go wrong should result in the raising of exception
      - Exception is a class with many subclasses for specific things that can go wrong
      - use try catch block
    - Interface
      - abstract class but cannot have executable statements
      - abstract class with only abstract method
      - a class can be subclass of only one class where it can implement any number of interfaces
      - variable can be declared of type interface which means
        - you can put in that variable instances of any class that implement an interface 
        - the only drawback is only call methods on that variable that are listed on the interface definition
      - java interfaces: 
        - Runnable, Collection, Iterator, Comparable, Clonable
