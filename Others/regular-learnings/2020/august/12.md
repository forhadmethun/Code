# Imposter Syndrome
 - doubt about ability
 - I don't belong to here
 - it's normal!!
 - external source can increase the syndrome. Mother said you don't belong to there, you can studied lower grade college!!
 - fight with it, because you have the ability to be here, that's why you're here!! Okay??

# Growth mindset
 - work hard and thus getting the result
 - if failed, then maybe more effort needed to succeed, (fixed mindset: um useless)
