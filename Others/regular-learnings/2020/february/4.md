### System Design
    - Design Tinder
      - requirement gather
        - profile
          - Where to store data?
            - blob or file storage?
            - blob: binary large object
            - database facility: mutability, transaction, access control, indexing
            - file: faster, cheaper, CDN
          - What are the services needed?
            - client -> profile service: store data to db
            - account service/ authentication service
            - proxy server/ gateway server
            - decouple the system into microservice
              - image service
            - dfs: distributed file server
            - db:
              - prfile_id, image_id, image_url
        - recommendation
          - Recommendation Service
          - age, gender, location
          - database:
            - cassandra
            - mysql : sharding
              - dividing by some property
              - master slave structure
              - sharde by location 
        - match
          - Matcher Service
          - Materh & session for sending messaging
          - we can store client side if we don't want to keep track already swapped
        - messaging
          - http won't work well, need polling
          - use xmpp(extensible messaging and presence protocol) protocol
          - Session service

### Java String Comparison
 - sorting is solely based on order. You define the order that should be used. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. In ascending order, 5 is smaller than 10, so "negative". If you want descending, 5 should be ordered AFTER 10, so positive. Hope that makes sense. â€“ GhostCat salutes Monica C.
 - so in general if we need sorted order then in the compare(obj1, obj2) method we'll do
   - obj1.compareTo(obj2) or obj1 - obj2  or -1 /* if we need increasing order  it returns negative */
   - obj2.compareTo(obj1) or obj2 - obj1  or 1 /* if we need decreasing order it returns positive*/
   - 0 /* if we don't need to change order */
