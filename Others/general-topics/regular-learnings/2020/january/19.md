# System Design
### Design Tiny URL
#### Use case, Constraints, assumptions, Requirement
include:
- paste same link and the output will be some short url corresponding to that link
- by hitting the short url you'll redirect to the original link
- expire after certain time
exclude: 
- analytics
- user account
- customize url
assumptions:
- (1/10) twitter user = (1/10) 300M = 30M
- per request
  - link size :  2KB
  - created at : 8B
  - expire at : 8B
  - short link size: 8B(link length 7 or 8)
- 10M write request / month
- 100M read request / month
- 2.5M seconds / month
- 40 write request / second
- 400 read request / second
- 1B read request / month
#### Create a High Level Design
clients -> Web Application -> response


#### Design core components
database
    - SQL
      - indexing
    - NoSQL
      - eventual consistency
APIs
    - createShortURL(longURL)
    - getLongURLFromShortURL(shortURL)
#### Scaling
database:
    - SQL
      - Sharding
      - Federation
load balancers

servers

Applications
    - Zookepers - coordination servie 




### *InnoDB vs MyISAM
 - transaction
 - row level locking
 - doesn't support fulltext index
 - performance speed is slow 
 - better while deal with large scale data as transaction
 - as row level locking so inserting/updating faster
 - auto_increment is part of index
 - once table deleted cannot be restablished
 - count(*) reads whole table as not table level
 - supports foreign key referential integrity

### RDBMS
ACID Property
Scaling
    - Master Slave
    - Master Master
    - Sharding
    - Federation
    - Denormalization
    - SQL Tuning

NoSQL
BASE
CAP Theorem
Consistency Pattern
    - Weak Consistency
    - Eventual Consistency
    - Strong Consistency

#### Benchmarking
- process of load testing a component or entire IT system to determine performance characteristics of IT system. 
Profiling
- goal: 
  - to test the system to measure how a change affects its performance characteristics
  - to test and tune the system to reach a performance requirement or service level agreement(SLA). series of benchmark tests are conducted in conjunction with iterative cycle of performance tuning. 
#### Profiling
- let us find bootlenecks so that we can do least amount of work to get biggest practical performance
- any measurable resource can be profiled(not just cpu) such as - cpu time, memory usage
 - collecting statistics how often a resource is used and who is using the resource 
#### Amazon S3
 - amazon simple storage service
 - object storage service that offers industry leading scalibility, data availability, security & performance
#### Amazon Redshift
 - internet hosting service and data warehousing 
 - fully managed, cloud-based, petabyte scale data warehouse service by AWS
 - efficient solution to collect and store all your data and enables you to analyze


#### RPC
 - inter process communication that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another adress space(commonly on another computer on shared network) without programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. 
 - in RPC, client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space usually in a remote server. 
 - the procedure is coded as it were a local procedure call.
 - protocol:
   - client program
   - client stab procedure
   - client communication module
   - server communication module
   - service stab procedure
   - server response
#### REST
 - architectural style client-server model where client acts on service/resources managed by the server. 
 - stateless, cacheable
 - 4 qualities:
   - identify resources(URI in http)
   - change with representations(verbs in http)
   - error code(http status code)
   - hateoas(html interface)
