- [] Write pseudo code to implement LRU in real time OS.
- [] Write code to convert given number into words (eg 1234 as input should output one thousand two hundred and thirty four)
- [] Write anagrams code when you are given an isWord() function in the fastest possible ways and also write test cases for that. After this the HR asked me to come on next day

### set 4 

### set 5

question from OS:
- [] ….i) You have 10 GB of RAM, and you load multiples instances of a program of size 1 GB( let’s say more than 10 instances), then what will happen, how the OS handle this situation and up to what extends?
- [] ….ii) producer – consumer problem
- []You have given a number N, print all balanced parenthesis expression which can be generate using N pairs of open and close braces. For ex. for N=3, ((())),()()(),()(()),(())()

- [] You have given a adjacency matrix of a graph, find the number of connected component set of the graph.
- [] A string str and two character a and b are given to a function, find out the minimum distance between these two given characters in the str. first I gave him a bruce force solution( O(n^2) ) then he ask to optimize it ( O(n) ) and finally somehow i was able to do it.
- [] You have n processes and m available resources, explain each step of OS in the execution of those process along with which data structure will be suitable at a condition, which scheduling algorithm will suit best, also in case of preepmtive scheduling, waiting queue etc.. its take a long time to explain him. but finally he is satisfied with my answers.
