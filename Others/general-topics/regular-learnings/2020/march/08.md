#  CCNA - Introduction to Networks
## Chapter 1
### 1.3.2.2 Fault tolerance
 - network should be always available
 - millions of people rely on
 - limit impact of failure
 - quick recovery
 - multiple way to go destination
 - redundancy
 - packet switching network
   - packet switching split message into packets and routed over shared network
   - each packet has necessary info to reach destination and may take different route
   - receiver doesn't know anything about it
 - circuit-switching
   - usually for voice communication
   - establish a dedicated circuit between source and dest
   - if unexpectedly terminated then need to initiate need connection
### 1.3.2.3 Scalability
 - scalable network can suppoert new users and applications without impacting the performance of the service delivered to the existing users
 - newtorks are scalable as designers follow accepted standard and protocols
 - thuse this allows h/w and s/w vendor to focus on improving products and services without worrying  about designing new rules for operating within the network
### 1.3.2.4 Quality of Service
 - some services need more priority like video/audio streaming so we can introduce dedicated line for those  to priotize
 - congestion occurs when demand of bw increases. measured bps while simultaneous communications are attempted accross the network it exeeds availability, creating network congestion
 - when congestion occurs then priotize service get the resource and devices queue, and hold the packets in memory and transmit later when the resource become available to transmit
### 1.3.2.5 Security
 - network infrastructures provide personal and business asset
 - two types of network security concern
   - network infrastructure
     - physical security of devices provide network, unathorized access on the software on the device
   - information
     - securing packet being transmitted over network 
 - network security goal : 3 requirements
   - C
   - I
   - A
### 1.3.2.6 Activity Reliable Network
    - Fault Tolerance: Network should be always available
##   1.4 Changing Network Environment
###  1.4.1 Network Trends
#### 1.4.1.1 New Trends
 - new trends will affect ogranizations and consumers
   - bring your own device
   - online communication
   - video communication
   - cloud communication
#### 1.4.1.2 Bring your own device
 - any device, any ownership, used anywhere
 - ex: student access campus resources via phone/internet
#### 1.4.1.3 Online collaboration
 - necessary for business, student, individual etc.
#### 1.4.1.4 Video Communication
 - comminicating
 - telepresence
#### 1.4.1.5 Cloud Computing
 - global trend
 - string files, hdd & services, tarining new personnel, software licensing
 - 4 types of clouds
   - private
   - public
   - hybrid
   - custom
 - CC possible for data center. only owned by big companies as costly to maintain so smaller organization rent
#### 1.4.2 Network technologies for home
#### 1.4.2.1 Technology trends in home
 - smart home
 - cooking, smartphone instruction, notify
#### 1.4.2.2 Powerline Networking
 - same wire for power, networking 
 - while wireless not available
#### 1.4.2.3 Wireless Broadband
 - WISP
   - similar to WLAN 
   - need tower and subscriber need antenna
   - similiar to ISP
 - Wireless Broadband
   - use same cellular tech phone / internet
   - antenna is installed
   - some place it is competing DSL and cable services
#### 1.4.3 Network Security
#### 1.4.3.1 Security Threats
 - internal
 - external
   - virus, worm, th
   - spyware, adware
   - zero-day, zero-hour attack
   - hacker attack
   - ddos
   - data interception
   - identity theft
 - corporate data more valueable
#### 1.4.3.2 Security Solutions
 - small network
   - antivirus
   - firewall
 - big network
   - firewall
   - ACL
   - Intrusion prevention system
   - vpn
#### 1.4.4 Network Architecture
#### 1.4.4.1 Cisco Network Architecture 
 - foundation of networks are switch, router : transports all data
#### 1.4.4.2
 - CCENT(cisco certified entry network technician)
   - first part of CCNA
 - CCNA
#### 1.5.1 Conclusion
