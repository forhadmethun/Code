# Networking
## CCNA 1 - Chapter 6 (Network Layer)
### Summary
 - allow end devices to exchange data across the network
 - four basic processes
   - ip addressing
   - encapsulation
   - routing
   - decapsulation
 - IPv4
   - 32 bit
 - IPv6
   - 128 bit
   - better routing efficiency
   - simplified extensions header
   - pre flow processing
 - routing
   - hosts need local routing table to ensure packets to direct to the correct destinition
   - basically contains
     - direct connection
     - local network route
     - local default route
       - is the route to the default gateway
 - default gateway
   - ip of router interface connected to the local network
   - if packet destinition isn't same network then sent to default gateway for further processing
   - when default gateway gets a packet it examines the destinition ip address to determine the destination network
     - routing table of routers stores information about directly connected routers and remote routes to iP network
     - if router has entry of the route then router might forward else if no entry then sent to the its own default route, or it will drop the packet
 - routing info can be configured manually on each router to provide static routing or routers may communicate info dynamically using routing protocol
 - in order to router to be reachable, interface must be configured
