### System Design 
#### How to approach a problem
 - requirement clarification
 - api / system interface 
 - back to back envelop
 - data model
 - high level design
 - detailed design
 - scaling

#### Design tinyurl
 - what is tinyurl?
 - requirement
   - functional 
     - url to short url
     - short url to url
     - expire
     - specify url name
   - non functional
   - extended
     - analytics
 - capacity estimation
   - 400 url/sec => 1b url / month => 1b * 100byte /m => 100GB /m => 1.2TB/y => 1.2 * 10 TB/ 10y => 12 TB/10y
   - traffic
     - r : w => 100 : 1
     - 400 * 100 url / sec
   - storage
   - bw estimate
   - memory
 - system apis
 - db design
   - user
   - url
 - high level design
   - encoding
     - 64 ^ 6
     - md5 => 128 hash => base64 => 21 character => take first 6
     - create duplication
     - we can create some increasing sequence number and append with the url then hash
     - offline generation:
       - KGS
       - concerrency issue solve: two db, used, unused
 - partition and replication
   - range based
   - hash based
 - Cache
   - 20 - 80
   - LRU
 - LB
 - db cleanup
 - telemetry
 - security and permission

 - usecase 1: url to short url
 - usecase 2: short url to url
 - usecase 3: analytics
 - usecase 4: service delete expired url

#### Design Pastebin
 - KGS
#### Design Instagram
 - high level design
   - upload image/ video, stored in object storage, saved metadata in db and other user can view image/video
 - object model
   - user
   - photo
   - userfollow
 - detailed design
   - seperate read and write server. say 500 connection perserver
 - reliability & redundancy
 - data sharding
   - user id?
   - photo id + shard id
     - how to generate photoid? auto increment in some database or KGS. inc by 1 & inc by 2
   - epochtime + photoid 
 - generate news-feed
   - approach 1: for a user find followers, go through their photos and put that to ranking algo and generate 100photos and give back to user - huge latency. 
   - approach 2: pre generate feed continuously and save it to another table so if need to regenerate then look this table and take last generated time and looks for onward entries. 
 - how user will get the newsfeed
   - push
   - pull
   - hybrid

#### Design Dropbox
 - high level design
   - need sync mechanism
   - db for metadata
 - Design Core components
   - Client Program
     - up/download
     - track changes
     - handle conflict
     - divide file into chuncks of 4MB
     - keep metadata copy in client also
     - need long polling
     - 4 parts
       - chuncker
       - watcher
       - indexer
       - internal db
     - metadata db
     - sync service
       - send chuncks
       - compute hash to check if changed anything
       - verify with metadata
       - pull any change
       - push change
     - Message Queue service
     - Cloud/Block storage
   - File ProcessingWorkflow
   - Data Deduplication
   - Metadata Partitioning
     - federation
     - range based
     - has based
   - Caching
   - Load Balancer
   - File Sharing/ Securit, Permission
#### Design Fb Messenger
 - High level design
 - Detailed component design
   - message handling
     - pull
     - push
     - websocket/ long polling
   - storing and retriving message to db
   - maintain session connection as object in ram
 - storage system
   - hbase(once buffer is full it dump data to disk) on base of hdfs, big table
 - managing user status
   - we can show the active user in the user viewport
   - can be pulled while openning the app
   - while send message
 - data partitioning
   - userid in hash based
 - Cache
 - Load Balancer
 - replication
 - group chat
 - push notification
   - notification server
#### Design Twitter
 - high level design
   - user tweet, go to server, store in storage and store in db and return 
 - data partitioning scheme
   - user id
   - tweet id
   - timestamp + tweet id (good)
     - different tweet will be saved in different paritition so we need aggregation srevers to aggregate all the data get from different paritition
 - Cache
   -  hashmap of ownerid and list of tweet of last few days
   -  20 - 80, LRU, memchache
 - Timeline Generation
   - see fb feed
 - LB
 - Monitoring

#### Design Youtube / Netflix
 - Detailed Component Design
   - save file on HDFS
   - master slave architecture to distribte read/ write
   - bigtable for thumnail
   - video upload
   - video encoding
     - resulation
     - format
     - size
   - the videos can be sent from application server to a message queue which will give the data to encoder service for encoding and then save to the storage 
   - there will be cache, cdn
   - ex: netflix use Open Connect, 
   - metadata sharding
     - userid
     - videoid(accepted)
   - LB
   - Cache
   - CDN
   - Fault Tolerance

#### Design Twitter Search
 - High Level Design
   - need to store all the info to db and maintain index
   - can maintain index of words and hashmap where key would be the word and vlaue  would be the tweetIDs
 - Fault Tolerance
 - Cache
 - Load Balancer
 - Ranking
#### Design Web Crawler

   - how to crawl
     - dfs
     - path-ascending
   - components
     - url frontier
       - fifo
       - distribute among threads
       - if filled then dump to the db
