### Simple Factory
 - you're building house so need doors. So will you make the doors by your own with wood,  glue, nails  and all other tool? won't it be a mess? - Yeah!! we need just door so we can get it delivered from some factory & don't need to know anything about making doors.
 ``` 
generate instance for client without exposing instantition logic 
```
### Factory Method
 - based on position HR delegates interview to different people
 ``` 
way to deletegate instantiation logic to child classes 
 ```
### Abstract Factory
 - to build house we might need different type of doors - wooden from wooden shop, iron from iron shop, pvc from related shop & we might need different guy with related specialization to fit the door - carpenter, welder etc.
 ``` 
factory of factories ; a factory which group related factories together without specifying concrete class 
```

### Builder
 - you want custom make burger from restaurant and in the restaurant they have a single class with multiple properties so whenever you place order with specific requirement(properties) then the restaurant burger builder creates the object based on the requirement.
 
``` 
Allows to create different flavors of object from class avoiding constructor pollusion.  
```
### prototype
- all about cloning. Recall first cloned sheep.
``` 
create object based on existing object through cloning.
```

### Singleton
- at a time there can be only one president.
```
