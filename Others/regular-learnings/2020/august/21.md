# Javascript 
 - while running first global execution context created
## Javascript Execution Concept
 - two phase
   - creation
     - creates memory space for functions and variables where variables are set to undefined
   - execution
     - run the code line by line 
 - while new method is created then new execution context created and put on the top of the stack ( ** call stack ** ) and related variables are placed on the corresponding stack frame, if some variable not found then it searches for it's parent scope

## Asynchronous
 - javascript is single threaded syncrhonous -> means code run once at a time
 - how to handle async?
   - The browser contains several module
     - parser
     - js engine
     - http request hander
   - the different modules can run async but js is sync 
   - the browser which is putting thing asynchronously in the **event queue**
     - event queue
       - some click event
       - http request
     - firstly execution context completes it execution then looks in the event queue and if there is something placed by the browser then new context created and executed so it's handled in single threaded fashion 
   - javascript synchronously deals with the async event's are happenning

## Typing
 - Js use dynamic typing
 - Primitive Type
   - represents single value
   - not an object
 - js types
   - undefined ( leave it for engine to set)
   - null (use to serve purpose or wherever needed)
   - boolean
   - number
   - symbol (* in es6)
## Operators
    - special type of function written differently/syntactically 
    - Precedence
      - higher called first ( remember operator nothing but function that returns a value, +(3,4) that's pathetic so infix 3 + 4)
    - Associativity
      - = is right to left
    - see mozilla's js precendence sheet

## Coercion
    - converting a value from one type to another
    - 1 + '2' 
    - 1 < 2 < 3 => true < 3  => true
    - 1 >2 > 3  => false > 3 => false
    - Number(undefined) => NaN
    - Number(null) => 0
    - 3 == "3" 
      - it  gets coerced and returns true
    - false == 0
      - retunrs true as gets coerced
    - null == 0 
      - returns false!!! 
    - "" == 0
      - returns true
    - "" == false
      - returns true
    - USE `strict equality`
    - "" === false
      - returns false
    - 99% use tripple thingy!!
    - Boolean("")
    - Boolean(undefined)
    - Boolean(null)
      - all returns false

## Default values
 - even if we include multiple js file, it treats that all files put sequencially in a single file*
## Object
 - method are something that is inside object
