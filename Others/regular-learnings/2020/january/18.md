# System Design Concepts
### Cluster
 - group of servers/ other resources that act like single system and enable high availability and in some cases, load balancing, parallel processing
 - in pc, cluster is logical unit of file system on a hard disk
### MapReduce
 - core component of apache hadoop
 - hadoop is resilient, can process bulk amount of unstructured data via computer clusters. nodes of each cluster have their own storage(file system) and can process information. mapreducer comprises of two functions(components) - can filters and places(distributed) work to various nodes within cluster via function called mapper and orginizes and reduces (get) the result from the node and produce result as query called reducer. 
 - has the ability to tackle huge dataset by distributing processing across many nodes and then combining or reducing the results of those nodes as a whole
 - ex: find how many times each word appears in a book.if we distributed the task among 26 works and they find by character wise and in the end combine those 26 box results as a whole
 - ex: fb can use determine potential friend based on friends, colleague, location, activity, etc. book website can use mapreduce to examine search criteria and history behaviorto create customized offerings
 - components: JobTracker(ResourceManager), TaskTrackers(NodeManager), JobHistory Server

### Hadoop
 - open source distributed processing framework that manage data processing and storage for big data application in scalable clusters of computer servers. 
 - center of big data technologies to support - advanced analytics, predictive analysis, data mining & machine learning

### Analytical Data 
 - collection of data used to support decision making/ research basically stored on read only datbase
 - ex: market data, sensor data, transaction data, natural language, machine data

### Distributed file system
 - client/server based application which allows client to access and process data stored on server as if it is on local computer. 
 - while accessing local copy is saved on client side then chagnes are cached and pushed later after processing 


# OS
### scheduling
 - fcfs
 - round robin
   - priority in rr
     - execution plan
     - problems
       - stravation
         - low priority task don't get run 
         - threads wait indefinitely
       - dead lock  
         - not strictly problem but if low priority task has lock needed by high priority
         - circular waiting for resources
           - thread a owns res 1 and waiting for res 2
           - thread b owns res 2 and waiting for res 1
           - deadlock is one type of stravation but not vice versa 
         - deadlock not always deterministic
         - deadlock occur with multiple resources
           - cannot check for each resource independently
         - ex: system with 2 disk drives and two threads
           - each thread needs two drivers to function
           - each thread gets one disk and waits for others
     - how to fix?
       - dynamic priority based on different property
 - lottery scheduling
 - short job first
 - real time scheduling as edf
 - multi level scheduling
 - Linux CFS Scheduling: fair fraction of cpu
