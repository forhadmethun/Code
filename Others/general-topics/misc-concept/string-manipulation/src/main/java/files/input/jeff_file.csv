But I think overall for what you get, it shouldn't be all ... It should not be necessary for everybody. I think some people can really thrive in an environment like this, but I just don't necessarily love academia, personally. But I recognize it's necessary for career reasons.  //  Interviewer:	Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's really interesting. I've never had a class done that way, so that sounds really cool.

You know, hopefully, everybody ... hopefully, everybody comes out of college, generally speaking, more mature.[...]So, you know what?

I'm not really like part of like directly part of like the social justice scene, but like I have a lot of friends that are, so I'm sort of on the fringe of it. Tufts tends to be very conscious about like race, politics, and ... And race, politics, and this and that, and like white privilege, whatever, but on ... I think because it's ultimately like an institution of higher education, it tends to be a lot less conscious of class politics.

I think it was the majority of Tufts students come from backgrounds in households that are making $200-K plus a year.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	Or more a year. And, I guess, part of the issue was that, like, there's not a lot of representation of lower income students, but I think, for me personally, the ... Even really the bigger issue than that is just that this is sort of swept under the rug and something that students don't want to acknowledge. And you openly, again, talk about race, politics, talk about this, talk about that, but often times, the students leading these discussions are coming from, you know, high income brackets, very high income brackets.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	And I think that students don't want to really acknowledge themselves, and so I think sort of this ... There's not always ... Depending on a situation, it doesn't ... Not necessarily have to be like an explicit class divide.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	Because, you know, maybe like some of your friends come from like low income situations, some of them comes from high, or whatever.

That helped. // In addition to that I've done work on my own which is mostly like babysitting or working at a restaurant. That seems o be a shared experience with a lot of students at DePaul.

Interviewee:  For me it was a mixture of it just being doable so I thought I would do it and having the necessity financially. I took a lot of Community College classes when I was in High School by a lot I mean 3. DePaul being a quarter system the mixture of Community College classes that I took in High School and also the summer prior as well as AP, it ends up counting as a ... A semester transfers over as 1.5 credits and it kind of all came together like if I just take 18 credits as the limit, I'll get there. Turns out it was a good thing because then my mom told me she was like, ""Well we didn't know how we were going to pay for a 4th year so good thing you did that.""      It was kind of half way through I realized I was like, ""Oh I really got to do this actually."" // I think that for my college experience that was just really integral to my ... Because college is kind of like a nice middle ground where I was paying for my own expenses and being in charge of making sure I have a place to stay while my parents were helping out with tuition. I think that that's a really helpful opportunity to kind of step into adulthood but just getting you toes wet a little bit before being fully submerged.

Like I was like totally good with going to Olin and I figured everywhere else would sort of like reject me that I had left. And I was like, ""Okay, like Olin's done.""

A lot of, a lot of us are in a bubble, because Olin is tiny. And like it's hard to get off-campus. We are like in the middle of nowhere. So, it's like (laugh), um, I think there's sort of ... It gets into the problem that like a lot of students here like don't realize that like there is poverty down the street. Like we live in a really nice area, but like it's like affecting a lot more people than just the people in Africa or like the people in Ghana or something like that.    	So, I think there's like a lot of weird social things gong on here, where people don't ...    Interviewer:	Oh, really?

And the other thing that is like kind of like a weird trade off is like Olin, because it's like a very nurturing environment and like we leave keys in our doors and like we leave things in the lounge and you're never scared of anything getting stolen. Like you leave your bag like in the dining hall, you leave it like in the hallway, because like you don't want to take your bag into the dining hall. Like that's a mess. But like nothing ever gets stolen which is like really awesome, but also, it like ... I think a lot of people sort of don't have any responsibility, because like Olin's giving you so much. And like you have unlimited meal plans so you don't have to like worry about food and you don't have to worry about ... Like you have your own bathrooms, so you don't have to worry about using a public bathroom. Like there's a lot of ...    Interviewer:	Like every dorm room has it's own bathroom?

Interviewee:	Yeah. I can't even imagine. Like ugh. But like it's a very, it is a very nurturing environment and it's great in that. It's so awesome that I can leave my key in the door all the time and never worry.    Interviewer:	So what's the downside?    Interviewee:	So, the downside is that a lot of people have like no responsibility for anything. You know what I mean? Like they don't have the same sort of worries. Like they don't have to balance knowing how to take care of money and like resources and also doing school work. Like the only thing that they have to focus on is schoolwork, so a lot of other things get swept to the side.    	And like (sighs) it works here. But like one of the things I'm more nervous about when I graduate is not being able to like take care of myself.    Interviewer:	Yeah, be independent.    Interviewee:	Yeah, exactly.    Interviewer:	Sounds like a little bit too safe.    Interviewee:	Exactly. Exactly. // Interviewer:	And then you have to learn and to live independently as number two.    Interviewee:	Yeah. Again, that sort of goes back into like how we sort of don't have to ...    Interviewer:	Fear, fear.    Interviewee:	Do that here. Yeah, which makes me nervous. Um, yeah. Because like I think that's also important, because I don't want to end up like in some apartment somewhere with no money ...    Interviewer:	(laugh)    Interviewee:	Because I don't know how to do financial things (laugh). You know what I mean? Um, so yeah. That's another important one, because I think that college is a good time to figure out like ... Because it's like you can make mistakes in those types of things during college, and like not have the worst possible outcome.

Interviewee:  And having it be so, having wealth be so prevalent that like, to be otherwise is like rare, was like very surprising for me. Because at my high school, like, you know there were a lot of poor people and, um, it was just, it wasn't hard to find spaces with other people who were struggling but here it's been kind of hard for me. // Interviewee:  Okay, so basically what I mean by it being very wealthy is that like the students, the professors, are all from like wealthy backgrounds or are wealthy now and the overwhelming part of it is just the fact that, like people don't, people aren't very careful with their language when they talk about ...    Interviewer:  Yes.    Interviewee:  Like class. So, for example I remember, like on my first week here everyone wanted to go out to dinner and then everyone said ""Oh, it shouldn't be that expensive, it'll be like 40 dollars for the cab and then like 30 for dinner."" And you know everyone was okay with that but that's just something I haven't ... I was just like ""No!"" Like ""That's a lot of money.""

Anyone who doesn't have this life, I feel bad for you. You should have worked harder,"" but they don't under- ... And I'm not trying to take away from the fact that a lot of people worked hard to get here, but people need to understand that, like, opportunity and accessibility play a huge role in that and, like, that you wouldn't be here if you didn't do well on the SAT and you may not have done well on the SAT if you didn't have a mom who, like, paid $1000 for you to have a private tutor.    Interviewer:	Yeah?    Interviewee:	Or you, or if you didn't go to a high school where they offered more than, like, six AP courses. Like, people don't think about how opportunity shapes achievement.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

And like, I feel like a lot of them are first generations of Americans, because such a diverse um community. So I feel like a lot of them are just trying to prosper, and gaining something that they're family or their parents have instilled for them to achieve.//Interviewer:	Um, I was just saying uh, thinking about um, those students who go into college uh, with the idea that they want a career, um, how do you think ... or do you think there's anything that could change their mindset into being more about transforming themselves as you said?   Interviewee:	I mean, like, for the people who go into the mindset of a career, I feel like it's just because of their family and like, their background. I feel like when you come out of such like a poverty of like, poor state, and like, you just have this idea that you just want better for yourself, and the only way that you think better is is money wise.

You want to like, go out and start working, and that's fine. You do you, but if you want to become like, uh, if you want to like, increase like, your soul, or increase your knowledge and like, I feel like college is really for you // Yeah, I do.

I'm the first person to uh, like study, I'm a first generation American. Like, so, they really don't have an understanding of college or education itself. They don't understand that like, not being educated just creates ignorance if you're not educated.   	Many of the times when you hear like my parents opinion, you could like, tell them, oh, like, that's ignorant for you to say. And like, it's sad.

I don't know, but I think that, um, for a lot of people it does make a lot of sense.    Interviewer:  So do you have examples of ...    Interviewee:  Like the career oriented. And I think college enlightens you and helps you make more well informed decisions, like politically and stuff like that, and so, I mean, in that sense, yes, everyone should have that college mind set and really be able to be informed on the decisions they're making and be more open to the world around them, but that's not always possible, and I don't think our system is really set up like that now.    Interviewer:  Because ...    Interviewee:  Uh, I think financially we have a lot of institutions, um, and like the institutions themselves just can't support ... I don't know. I think that colleges are, um, there's not a wide enough range of colleges that are catering to the types of people that would want that type of an education at this point, so ... // Uh ... I think that there's a huge divide, um, people keep throwing the word privilege around, so there are a lot of people that feel like some are more privileged than them, whether that's socio-economically or racially, culturally, um, religiously, um, just the differences, um, even though mostly because so many people are so homogeneous there, there's a very, like, Kenyon student, and if you don't feel ... I think everyone overall fits that, but sometimes people feel that specific parts of them don't quite fit that overall mold and that the Kenyon community isn't always good at making them feel comfortable.    I think one of the biggest is socio-economically and racially, if you don't fit that mold, then people have trouble, um, communicating that and trying to figure out how to make that work, um, and sometimes people just get very hot headed and don't listen and get really, um, angry with other sides, and there's such a predominant view on campus that if you don't fit that viewpoint, it's not easy to be heard, which is unfortunate because Kenyon promotes open dialogue and ideas and sometimes that just doesn't occur. // I worked at the athletic center, I did a lot of jobs because I had to ...

I've had three or two jobs like all four, the last four years, I've always worked. And like I, it's hard to manage my money, so like coming to college, especially like when I didn't know how to cook or like stuff like that, I was always eating out. I was always going out and wanting to do fun things.    	And the student population here tends to be like upper class, so like a lot of my friends wanted to do like extravagant things, so for a while I was in adjustment because I like I was spending more money than I had and it was, it was, that was a big adjustment for me, is like learning how to manage my spending and stuff like that. // Interviewee:	So, I don't think it necessarily is.

Or maybe have the professors put mostly everything on pdf on our websites where our classes are.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	So we're not paying as much in textbook fees. Or make everything more interactive, like have the classes be more interactive, like more discussion-based rather than just PowerPoints. // Interviewee:	I take, like most of my General Education courses are online.

Um, resource, resources-wise, like, academically, like I said, like just going to your advisor. Um, there's plenty of resources for people with AD, ADHD, like Student Life or Disability Services. Um, just stuff like that. Work-study. I've had work-study jobs the last four years, so that's through the government, but, um, there's plenty of work-study opportunities on campus. Um, I'm trying to think of what else. Uh ... // Interviewee:	Um, I think, like, I mean, I guess my one concern is, my only, my only concern is financial aid.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	But I got a scholarship through the alumni association that actually covered what I couldn't ...    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... afford.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	They just don't really care about your, they aren't very friendly about like, they just don't care about you personally, and that's an issue because I've had a lot of friends who go to other schools and they're, they're willing to work with you and find ways to like cover here and there, like what can't be paid for out of pocket.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And like, we do have a president now, President Drake, who is actually pretty good about financial aid, like he had, he just implemented like the President's Affordability Grant when he first became president here. And that's been helpful because you can get like $2,000 a semester. And, um, so that's helped me. But financial aid has been a huge struggle here, like they just don't care, like ...    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... they aren't ...    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	... that's one huge issue I have. // Interviewee:	And then I chose to get a job because, like I mentioned before, like there is the money aspect to this, too, like, uh, this is an investment. If you're going to college, like, you need to take it seriously, like, it, it's an investment for your future, but you also need to be able to pay off, like you need to be able to set yourself up for a positive and successful future, and like you need to have, be able to have a job when you get out of college, I think.    	Maybe it's not like your dream job at first, but you'll get there, as long as you are able to like pay back the investment somehow. // Interviewer:	Great. Well, we're more interested in what you think it means. You can always look it up later. Um, but that was really helpful. Thank you.

QUOTE: ""But it is a very expensive school. I mean, just the cost of living and tuition comes to about $48,000 a year so...And so, I made it work. And DePaul is great with financial aid, and a lot of people get that. But there are also a lot very upper middle class to wealthy kids here, so the socioeconomic aspect is somewhat diverse. But it's limited by the sheer cost. They do do a lot of great financial aid work, and they really have a lot of emphasis, to my knowledge, on first generation college students and that kind of thing. But just the cost is so limiting for a lot of people...So I did a Discover Program. I did Queer Chicago. So we moved in a week early, and we just had a week to do field trips and stuff around the city, which was great. So it's a very social time. You meet a lot of people. But a lot of the friends I've made during that time, as we transitioned out of that forced togetherness and it turned into just hang out on your own, their thing will be like, ""Oh, let's go to Barney's and go shopping."" And I'm like ""Hmm. Let's not go to Barney's. Let's not spend that much money."" I have a friend who just spur of the moment decided to buy a $1,700 coat. And it was like, who does that? Who has that kind of money?...So that gets weird sometimes just trying to hang out with people when half of us are like, ""Oh, we're gonna go chill out somewhere, read, whatever."" The other half are like, ""Let's go blow a couple thousand dollars."" It's like, ""Oh, let's not, I need that for food, tuition, books, healthcare."""""

I think that's like, a nice thing, but definitely not the most important thing. Um, number three, wow, these are tough, 'cause those are like ... Ugh, idealistic me is putting getting a job as number three, but realistic me is definitely not putting that. I guess I might put living in- I'd put live independently as number three. Because like, I'm gonna live independently next year, and if I'd like, graduated from high school and just gotten, gotten a job, I might have lived independently then. So that's number three, live independently. Um, number two, get a job, 'cause I think that's really important. But also, like, um, I think that gaining a different perspective on people, knowledge, and the world is the most important thing.    	And like, you ca- you can get a job like, not going to college for sure. There are like, um, not necessarily the same jobs, but like, there are jobs available, and you can make liva- like, earn a living and stuff. But I feel like this is really the best and one of the only was to gain a different perspective on people, knowledge, and the world. So that number one, getting a job two, living independently three, and studying content area, number four.    Interviewer:	Um, and so you and a lot of other people do put to get a job as pretty high on the list ...    Interviewee:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	Um, I mean like, I think that, like, I- I think it's so important to go to college, um, and like, it might influence like, how much you wanna spend on going to college. Um, but like, that you might not necessarily wanna go to a school that costs $60,000 a year when your return on investment might not be as high, and there are like, plenty of colleges you can go to. You can go to like, almost any college and graduate and get that job. Um, but [inaudible 00:49:36] like something really important to go and like, you'll learn so much in college.    //  Interviewee:	Um, so, okay, so problems or concerns, these are things that I would change, or these are things that I think are universally like, that a lot of people would say they would change?

I guess what would you, what do you think is the biggest issue and then what do you think that, you know, the school as a whole or the people at the school as a whole f- feel are issues right now.    Interviewee:	Yeah. Okay, so I think if I could change like one thing that I think is a problem with the school, I would have um, [inaudible 00:28:12] all four years living on campus all four years. I think that's just like, chiefly beneficial. Like, there are very few schools that do that. Um, like all of my high school friends lived off campus by their sophomore year. Um, and I like, was so glad that we had to live on campus sophomore year. But I think that it'd just be good if all lived in like, on campus apartments as juniors and seniors. Um, because like housing, finding housing off-campus is a challenge, and it just like, it takes away from some of the campus spirit.    	Um, as far as things other people say, I think that a lot of people complain about the lack of diversity on campus. Um, that like, both, racially to some extent, but socioeconomically to a huge extent. Um, I think there's like, a type of student that studies at a top tier private school, and I don't think it's necessarily a reflective type of student um, to the rest of the country, um, and so I think that um, I think that most people on campus, I think a lot of people on campus, I don't wanna say most, but I think that you would get that answer often. Um, and probably more often here than like, I think it's a problem at private schools everywhere, like private schools all across the country, but I think that it's more of a problem here than other places.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	I have to, I have to imagine it is. Like, I, like, I can't, I don't know. Um, yeah. I would have to imagine it's more of a problem here than other places.    //  Um, and then number one I'd definitely put as mental health issues. I like, should've put that as um, when, when you asked like originally [inaudible 00:34:22] mental health is definitely a big issue in that. Um, because of the stress and anxiety, um, and I think that a lot of that [inaudible 00:34:31] diversity that it's hard when you're a minority student and there are no, like very, very few other minority students here. Or it's hard like, um, I have one housemate who isn't from like an upper-middle class background, and like, everyone else is, it feels like, and so I think that that just adds a lot of just like, undue anxiety. And then I think with like schoolwork and like, in particular [inaudible 00:34:53] like, can add a lot of stress and anxiety to any college student.  //  "

Another big thing is that postgraduate planning, like, I love them, but they put a huge emphasis on, on, you know, income straight after college, and they brag about, you know, the average income is $80,000 and all these people make so much money, and look how many people go to Microsoft or Facebook or Google, and I don't think that's the most important thing that we should be emphasizing, um, because it puts a lot of pressure on people who aren't, you know, electrical and computing engineers, who aren't going to get paid six-    Yeah."""

It helped me establish myself, my benefits, to, you know, everything that scholarships, information, um, they help me build a program where I was able to finish school at a more faster rate than the average individual. Just the resources there compared to, you know, my first experience and my other experiences in college were never, ever the same, uh, the much, the detail, attention that I received from BMCC. // Interviewee:	Absolutely, um, when I got myself involved in the, um, I became, uh, president of the veteran's club.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	So I got to understand all the resources that were available for veterans. Um, for any work or G.I. Bill, any, any housing, anything that, anything rela-, veteran related, I got to experience that and obtain and absorb all the knowledge within that work today. I help a lot of, um, veterans entering college. And I, you know, I actually mentor them and help them, uh, pave an avenue for them so they will be prepared for success. // Mm-hmm (affirmative). So, when, um, the process of getting involved, when I became president, um, there were, there was a veteran running for president for student government. So I got to, you know, we got to f-, um, talk, and it was like politics. It was true politic. And we had to vote for him. He got voted in, and then I got ... I was intrigued. You know, it was a different, larger government. You know, they had a budget of $2 million that they had to deal with, so it was real money. It was real, um, bylaws. It was real government. So, and even in eh ... And they, and they, um, conducted themselves at, very appropriately. So that really intrigued me. // Um, let's say you've come from a disadvantaged, um, um, family, where you can't afford college; there's called the ASAP program will helps you, um, with, um, free metro card. It helps you with books. It helps you with tuition, that, you know, it helps you with all these other spectrums. So that, that's another thing for th-, for those who are disadvantaged. So say, uh, you need money for some, whatever reason. They, there is, there's called Stu- Student Life, where they help you out with financial discrepancies throughout the school, throughout college. Let's say you're, you're, you're a woman that is pregnant or has two kids, and it's hard for you. They have a children's program, where they take care of your children while you're in school taking classes. S-, um, so so many resources, like I said. It's so many, and I just gave you three. // Interviewee:	Um, I'd say another risk was, uh, a lot of the students would gather together to, to protest tuition. You know, they would, they would form up, and, and they would say this is, you know, ""We should be paying for college. We shouldn't be paying for college. We shouldn't be paying for college. I mean, college should be free. It should be access to all environ-, and people."" So these people that stood up for that, um, were able to now state senate of New York made, um, tuition free if you make, um, less than $200,000 a year, and tax credit if you got, if you went to school the year before.    	So people that do take these risks, um, it's because they truly believe this is correct. If you truly believe this is correct, and it's not killing or violence (laughs), then I think you should take, take that risk. // What role do I think that ... Um, for life, for the simple fact that, um, at BMCC they become your parents if you didn't have any. You know, they'll, they'll offer you all these, like I said, go back to the resources, eh, eeh, whatever you need to, to build your self-esteem, to build your financial stability, to build, to s-, to help your mental health; they, eh, they have it there. // Well, we need a job to sustain ourselves. That's most important, financially speaking, you know, um, but if you, if you gain this knowledge of the world and are, p-, study particular in depth, and you can get this job and be financially stable, so-called, you know, not perfect role for the rest of your life. // So that's a huge difference. So they come and ask me questions of, ""Oh, where do I get help? Where do I get financial aid? Where do I get this? Where do I get ..."" And they go to a whole different type of school, you know, different, um, diverse group or not, you know, and whether majority is black, white, yellow, green, or red, they-, they're not exposed to that either. So it's just two different worlds. // Interviewee:	Um, educational experience? The disparity of income.    Interviewer:	Okay. And can you just explain a little bit about why that was transformative for you to learn or to understand?    Interviewee:	Yeah. Absolutely. Um, I remember being in English class, and our professor was talking ... She was talking about, um, the American dream, whether it was true or not. And when she gave us the numbers of the, of the, you know, of, of the 1%ers that make the majority of the money, and compared to us, you know, I, I saw like, wow, us, you know, I guess the 90% of individuals were not, were, were not making ... There's not a boost and within our income. You know, the middle class, eh, I see a lot of middle class not obtaining the same income back in like, eh, they were in the 1970s.    	So I guess that generated some fire within me, and I didn't wanna become part of that. So I, you know, I said, you know, let's, let's ... I gotta get school. I gotta get, continue getting educated, and to make, uh, to find a way so I won't be part of those statistics, that statistics, basically.          "
1153,P077,School 9,High Importance,Freshmen,"HIGH IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: Talks about the need to work off campus to support himself and says that he feels he needs to be very involved in class because ""taxpayers are paying for it"" through the GI Bill. His advice to freshman would include telling other students to make the most of their time because someone is spending money on their education.  He feels that the school should offer a course in personal finance, saying that he's had to learn about that ""the hard way"" and later mentioning having to plan finances as part of the college transition. //    QUOTES: Interviewer:	And tell me about the transition to college.  Was there anything that you found surprising or that you weren’t completely prepared for as you went back to school?    Interviewee:	Yeah.  It’s just like high school only the work’s harder and there’s more drinking.  No, one of the reasons I actually kind of put off going back to school was that I felt like I’d had a hard time fitting in and all these things because of my time off.  So when I finally decided to go back I was really nervous about it.  As far as academically, I mean the work – it took a little getting used to.  It’s been a while since I’ve been in a classroom.  You know, I’ve been cruising by A’s and B’s so it’s not that bad but it’s really hard to relate to a lot of the kids there.  Just in life experience and just everything.  So that part is a little bit different than I thought it would be.  But it’s going pretty well.    Interviewer:	So tell me is it hard to relate to students based on your life experience but there’s certain things that sort of stand out to you again and again where they feel just so much younger?    Interviewee:	Oh, sure.  Like the GI Bill is paying for my tuition but I work in a bar here in Dover so that I pay rent and all these other bills.  So a lot of these kids, their families are paying for their schooling or taking out loans – stuff like that.  So when it’s like, “Hey, what’s going on tonight?”  Like, “Oh, we’re going down to the bar or we’re going to some crazy party or this and that.”  And it’s like, “Oh, okay well I have to work until midnight and then do a paper before I come back here tomorrow at 8:00.”  So you know, just different priorities.  //  Interviewer:	Yeah, that makes sense.  So what are your goals for the college experience now?    Interviewee:	Really to learn as much as I can.  I do – with the classes that I’m in all my professors know my name whether it’s a class of – last semester I had a class where there were like 15 of us and the biggest one I’ve had so far is 300 of us.      Interviewer:	Wow.    Interviewee:	Yeah.  And I try to make the point of staying involved in – sometimes to the point of talking too much – but I want to learn.  Even if it’s not something related to my major I’m like, “Well, I have to spend my time here.  Taxpayers are paying for it.  I might as well get the most of it that I can.”  So regardless of what it has to do with my actual history degree I feel like I kind of have a responsibility to be the best I can in everything and I’ve already learned a lot.  It’s been really fun.    Interviewer:	And you say that all the professors know your name. Is that because you’re outspoken in class or do you also make time to meet with them as office hours or in outside of class time?    Interviewee:	I’m definitely outspoken in class.  But as far as meeting with them outside of class it really depends.  Most of my history classes for example – except for my strongest point – I haven’t really had to even email the professors or anything because if I have an issue I’ll talk to them really quick or I don’t – if it’s something I do have a problem with – I’m in my second semester of German right now and that’s been challenging for me.  So I’ve met with my professor a couple of times but everybody’s been available if I need them and sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t.  //  Interviewer:	That’s great.  Now if you were – let’s say – Dean of the college and could start from scratch to design an academic program for students to take while they’re on campus for four years, what would that program look like?  What kinds of knowledge or information do you think would be most important for students to be exposed to and learn?    Interviewee:	There would be a lot of what’s in place now I think is good. But there are a couple of things that I would add.  I was looking the other day when I was getting ready to register for classes, I have to take a math class at some point – which I’m dreading.  And I think that a lot of the math classes that are offered at the university level are things that honestly people aren’t ever going to use unless they’re going into something that’s related to math or science and then it’s pretty important.      I think something that should be offered is – and maybe they do it at the high school levels – is a class in personal finance.  You know, you hear about all the people that – especially young people – that get into crazy trouble with credit cards or with loans, car payments – any kind of financing.  Or even just managing their money, balancing a check book.  A lot of people can’t do that and it’s something I’ve had to learn the hard way a couple of times.  And so I think – maybe if you want to require students to take certain classes they should be things that will help them immediately as soon as they graduate right then.  Something about personal finance, something about – that’s probably the biggest thing honestly.  Because I feel like a lot of people have trouble with it.  Especially young kids.  //  Interviewer:	All right.  In what ways does the college education and the college experience influence your personal development?    Interviewee:	Well the biggest thing like right off the bat is time management.  I haven’t always been the best at it. And when you’re in classes that professors don’t seem to think you’re taking any other classes with their homework load.  So you really learn how to juggle all these things and still make it into work.  Still try to make time to see family and occasionally go do something fun for yourself.  You know, plan your finances and all that.  So there’s a lot of – the biggest thing right off the bat was just organizing your time and your resources.   //  Interviewer:	What about administrators.  How do you think they would define the goal of the college experience?    Interviewee:	Giving them our money.  No I’m sure they would define the goal as becoming a well-rounded, educated person and a great addition to society.  I don’t know.  I’m sure it’s something along those lines.  //  "
1060,P047,School 3,High Importance,Seniors,"CONTEXT I think this student points to monetary limitations to one's college experience in both a general and personal sense. At the beginning of the interview, the participant discusses how the entire pre-college experience is framed by the type of education you have and that his own application process was conditioned by financial aid. Later in the interview, he discusses the fact that moving into Chicago was a big financial risk for him but that he did it anyway since he felt it was so central to his college experience. He also mentions finances in relation to several of his friends, most of whom do not attend DePaul. // QUOTES ""Well, it's difficult because how the American economy is operating right now, it's very difficult for everyone to get to college. And there's a lot of discussion about stuff like six year high schools, and making sure people graduate with an associate's degree and stuff like that. And then there's also a lot of trade stuff, and it's difficult to say because I know a lot of friends that say if they could have, they come from working class families, and they say if they could have they just would've gone to trade school. One of my good friends he says, ""I would have just gone work for Con Med if I could've, but my parents made me go to college"". And obviously there's a large percentage of the population that's like those jobs are things that have to be done. Things like services, and mechanical, and things like that, that don't necessarily require a college education, but then there's a lot of other trades."" // ""But in retrospect, I should have broadened my horizons. But again, I didn't have anyone telling me to do that. My dad was just ecstatic that I was going to college. And my mom just left it up to me. And then again, Main West didn't prepare me at all. So I just had to do the whole process myself.    0:04:43 S1: Right. So how did you approach it?     0:04:46 Luke: I just mostly...    0:04:47 S1: Just knowing what's in the area or...    0:04:49 Luke: Yeah. That was a lot of it. And then there was also looking at schools that I knew I could get in to. I got into Loyola, DePaul and UIC. And then I chose DePaul because I knew that it was slightly had more connections than UIC, but it wasn't as expensive as Loyola. 'Cause money was also a factor. Cause I was gonna stay on campus but my parents didn't have a whole lot of money to do that, 'cause my mom and dad are divorced. And my first quarter at DePaul, I had so many grants, my parents only paid like two grand.    0:05:24 S1: Wow.    0:05:25 Luke: Out of the $30,000 tuition.   0:05:28 S1: That's great. Yeah.    0:05:30 Luke: But yeah. So I just decided to myself because it was just kind of in the middle.    0:05:36 S1: Yeah, right. Right.    0:05:38 S1: I didn't realize that it was less expensive than Loyola.    0:05:40 Luke: It's...    0:05:41 S1: Slightly.    0:05:42 Luke: Slightly, 'cause I think Leola now is like 35, 36 and DePaul is 33. And back then they were like three grand more. And in my mind... See, here's the thing. In my mind, I acquitted Loyola and DePaul as basically the same school."" // "": I often discuss with a lot of my peers and people that go to Loyola, their Medical Program for example is a lot more superior than ours. But our business program is far superior to theirs, as an example. And just also the nature that they're Jesuit, we're Vincentian. They're smaller, we're larger and they are predominantly a lot more upper income. One of my best friends, she goes to Loyola and she's low income but the student body as a whole is a lot more upper income than De Paul. De Paul, we have students that have come from Inglewood and the poor sections of Chicago. We also have really affluent students. Just like a lot more of a spread."" // "" a good portion of the class involved going to extraordinarily low income areas like North Lawndale, we're gonna go to Englewood but never got quite there, parts of uptown, little village, we went to... And then we also visited more, I guess, middle strata but, more towards the lower income side of things such as Humboldt Park and Pilsen.    0:24:51 Luke: And that was an experience you can't get in the classroom. Seeing, being... I remember being an 18 or 19 year old kid seeing North Lawndale for the first time and it completely flips around the experience and it completely flips around how you're gonna look at the material in the classroom when you actually see like... There in North Lawndale, it's a section of Chicago, 30,000 people, one bank, one supermarket. Not even a Jewel, not even an Aldi it's like a save a lot market that has extraordinary low cost canned items. You go down the street and it's closed shop, currency exchange, liquor store, church. And I work in a lot of these communities now and that's opened up my world view. And that's just, for an example, something you can't get in the classroom but really makes you understand the world very differently."" // ""Okay. How was it to be a commuter student? What do you think are the pros or cons of living on or off campus?     0:29:38 Luke: To be honest, the only con about living on campus is the money. I commuted for my first two years and a quarter and then..."" // "" I took a big risk when I moved out.    0:47:46 S1: How do you decide to do that?     0:47:48 Luke: That was just because I knew I needed to move out because my home life was getting nuts. But mostly just the commute was just a drain. Like I said, it was three hours of my day was spent traveling and I'm like, what am I doing? And just that I knew that I was an adult. I was 21 years old. I'm like, I have to move out. This is the 21st century. This is what people do. My girlfriend, she moved out of the house and she went to boarding school at 15 in Pennsylvania and never came back. Ever since then, she's been not living at home.    0:48:31 S1: So are you glad you took that risk?     0:48:33 Luke: Yeah. It was a big risk because I had $5,000 or $6,000 in the bank and for the longest time, I couldn't find a job for five or six months and then eventually through some networks, I got a job at a bar. But yeah. It was pretty close but that was a risk, but I knew I had to do it."""

And I've been trying to turn over a new leaf since then.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	You know, the issue was Queens College only helped me accomplish two of those goals. I never really met any people in my life, but, you know, I've been working harder to do better in school and you know-   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	I take more pride in my work than I did in high school. Um, yeah. I don't know.   Interviewer:	Um, so what do you sort of wish had been in place in order for you to better, kind of realize your goals then?   Interviewee:	To better what?   Interviewer:	To better realize the goals that you had coming in?   Interviewee:	Uh, to better realize them. [inaudible 00:12:01] I just wish I had worked harder in high school. 'Cause that was the one goal that I really felt like I missed, which was the social aspect, like it could've been averted if I had just worked harder in school and gotten into better colleges. Like, you know, I applied for certain colleges and they, and they didn't accept me. Like, you know, friends of mine went to NYU. And it's like, I could've went there, I just didn't put in the hours. Like I w- I'm as smart or smarter than some of these people who I was friends with-   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	You know, why are they going to NYU, why are people that I know going to like, um, Northeastern? You know, I could do that, but I just didn't, so ...   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	I should've just worked harder.   Interviewer:	So what are some of the other schools that you applied to that you really wanted to get into? If you don't mind sharing.   Interviewee:	Um, you know, I, I didn't really look at anything in um, Boston. I really, surprisingly I didn't have much of an idea of like, what I, where I wanted to go. I visited Drexel in Philadelphia, but it was less of a concern about them not accepting me and more so the financial thing, 'cause ... The thing, like, you know, my dad was a um, you know, a uh, he's an [inaudible 00:13:06] guy. Like, what his job is like, you know, um, real estate development and stuff like that. So he was really on this whole train of um, you know, the, the cost to benefit ratio kinda stuff?   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And so he was saying, spend $60,000, spending that money for you to go to Drexel, that name has no brand recognition.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	So like, if you went for a job and someone saw that you went to Drexel, it doesn't matter. If you spent, if you got a free ride there or if you spent 60,000, people don't recognize the name. So, well obviously I would've loved to go to a school like, you know, NYU. I applied to Hunter, and they, and they declined me. And then, you know, I applied to Baruch and they declined me when I was in high school but they would've accepted me in college due to my different grades.  	So you know, it was just um, I should've looked longer. Like I visited California, um, several years ago, and I loved Santa Cruz. And they have a university there that's pretty good. I, I could've been a Banana Slug, but you know.   Interviewer:	(laughs) Yeah.   Interviewee:	Didn't.   //Interviewee:	Um, I would say a lot of learning experience outside the classroom that I have had has been two things. It's been jobs and helping out around the house.   Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).   Interviewee:	One of the things I realized from, like still living at home, even though I go to college is the amount of responsibility that I have now, like I have to pick up my brother from school, he goes, still goes to high school, I have to drop him off at high school. You know, I have my dog around the house, and I have my laundry. You know, when my mom is busy, she's a teacher. Um, when she's busy I'll put away like, the dishes.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	You know, that kinda stuff. A lot of people who I know, who, they're living in their own apartment or they're going away to school, they haven't felt that kind of ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Pressure that you get when you, when you're trying to support like, I'll put it in air quotes, [inaudible 00:27:47] have a full time job for it, but ""support a family.""   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	In whatever minuscule way I have. Um, it's, it, it builds character. I hate to make it seem like, I'm not tryna toot my own horn, but like, you know, I've had to cook dinner at like, you know, the drop of a hat. I've had to do a bunch of things. And it builds character.   	And the other thing is like, uh, jobs, I would say.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Since high school I've had a lot more real world jobs ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And they've really taught me what I want to do in life and what I don't want to do in life.   Interviewer:	And so you've been working sort of, alongside your studies part time? Or ...   Interviewee:	Um, what was that? Sorry.   Interviewer:	No, I'm sorry. Just, so you've been working while you were studying as well? So you were working part time?   Interviewee:	Yeah.   Interviewer:	Gotcha.   Interviewee:	Um, I've done a whole range of jobs, if, I don't know if it's important for me to list them. It's up to you.   Interviewer:	No, I mean yeah, just getting a sense of what you've done could be interesting.   Interviewee:	Okay. So I was working as a test proctor at the school for a little while.   Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).   Interviewee:	I was working as a moving company for senior citizens.   Interviewer:	Oh wow.   Interviewee:	Flower delivery ... I worked at a wine shop.   Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And, the most real-world job that I had was that I was doing video for Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, so I was filming masses on Sundays.   Interviewer:	Oh wow.   Interviewee:	Yeah, that was like, I got-   Interviewer:	[crosstalk 00:29:17]   Interviewee:	Hm?   Interviewer:	That's a broad range of different things you've done.   Interviewee:	Yeah, like, that's, that's what's really taught me like, you know, I was at this, I was doing this thing for a moving company, and you know, I was working with the um, with some people who are really like, the salt of the earth. Like they were like, you know, people who had just like, their whole career was just moving boxes for other people. And like, that really like, taught me like, wow, like, some people really have it tough.   	You know ... Just one of the things that like, you know, when you do manual labor, when you do like uh, tedious jobs, arduous jobs ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Where you realize that you're working for other people. It's not rewarding. Like I was doing that flower delivery. I was delivering to um ... Because of where I live, one of the women who I would deliver flowers to was, her brother was the person who owns the New York Mets.   Interviewer:	Oh, wow.   Interviewee:	So she was frickin' loaded.   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	And so I, I delivered flowered to her. And I realize to myself, like I'm working for the 1%. Like you know, I'm just delivering flowers to these rich people.   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	And it's, it's not fruitful work. It's like, you know, I'm just, and I know that I'm only, I'm only 21, and like, what kinda jobs can I expect for myself? Like you know, I'm not going to be curing malaria or anything fruitful ...   Interviewer:	(laughs) Yeah.   Interviewee:	I need to think of something bigger. Like what you are doing is something bigger, you're working on like, this, on, on like a project like, thing, like I looked up what the um, mission statement was for this thing when I um, when I signed up for it. It's like you're, you're working on something bigger.   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	So, it's like, that's cool.   Interviewer:	So did that experience sort of give you a better idea of what you want in the long run?   Interviewee:	Um, yeah.   Interviewer:	In terms of a job?   Interviewee:	I would say just all of, all those jobs did.   //Interviewee:	Can I, can I just put one all down the middle?   Interviewer:	(laughs)   Interviewee:	'Cause I, 'cause I feel like each person would have a different reason to do something. So you know, if you're going into more of a liberal arts kind of field, you know, the second one, to gain different perspectives ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Might be important. If, you know um, if you, if you're going to school for like um, you know, molecular engineering, like you're one of these people that goes to MIT or like, you know, one of these kind of science schools ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Like, to get a job would be the crucial one for them because you know, their career derives around going and getting this education. To learn to live independently could work for, I don't know, you know, someone who's another one of these liberal arts kinda questions, like ""Oh yeah, now I can do it on my own."" It's just like ...   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	I don't know. To study a particular content area in depth, um, I guess that goes back to the thing with like the STEM kinda things, like going into a field that requires you to have an education in something. Like I couldn't just show up to, you know, the Met, or some place, and say, ""Oh yeah, I wanna be a curator. I'm interested in this."" They'd be like ""Have you gone to school for art history?"" And I'd be like ""Uh...""   Interviewer:	Yeah (laughs) yeah. I know, so it, it depends. But then, I guess maybe, if you, to get from your perspective, um, how you would rank them, to you then, personally?   Interviewee:	Okay, um ... Yeah. That's, that's the problem, is I'm thinking too big picture.   Interviewer:	No, that's good.   Interviewee:	Sorry about that.   Interviewer:	No, that's good. That, I noted all of that, that's great. I'm just tryna find a way to like, make you rank them, and I think if you think about it from your perspective that might help it, help you do that.   Interviewee:	All right. This is a selfish um, way to put it, but I'll put to get a job as number one.   Interviewer:	Yeah?   Interviewee:	Just because, you know, I, I, I need money right now.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	My girlfriend and I are tryna go on vacation and I don't have a job right now, so it's like, need money, I need to get a job. And showing off that I hae a four year degree helps you get like any job. If you say ""I'm going to college"" or ""I went to college,"" all of a sudden people look at you and they're like ""Oh, smart guy over here.""   Interviewer:	(laughs)   Interviewee:	So it's a good thing. Um, I, I'll put to gain a different perspective as two, don't worry, I'm not going down the line, one, two, three, four.   Interviewer:	(laughs) You can if you want. (laughs)   Interviewee:	(laughs) Um, I would say three would be to study a particular content area.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And then four would be to learn to live independently. 'Cause I mean, think about how many people like, go to college and then still they just move right back home once they're done? You know ...   Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	Doesn't matter what you, you know, living independently I guess is sort of a vague concept because ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	You know, you live in, you live in a like a world of such interconnectivity, you never really live independently.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	I mean you go to a supermarket, you buy like, potatoes, you're not farming the potatoes. If you lived independently you'd be growing them yourself.   Interviewer:	Right, right. And so a lot of people do rank, you know, getting a job high on the list. But what would you say to someone who are preparing for a certain job, but when they're educated, um, that job disappears?   Interviewee:	Well this is, this would go back to the importance of just getting a four year degree.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	So for instance, I was uh, I got a job at that place, Trinity, I was telling you about.   Interviewer:	Yeah.   Interviewee:	From getting that job, I realized that I don't wanna be a video technician. It's all part time work, and a lot of the people I know had multiple jobs. And all of them, for the most part, unless like, they were a manager, they didn't have a family. They were, you know, they, they were yuppies, they were, you know, young professionals living in a city. They were living in apartments and they were living a nice lifestyle because they had a job that paid like 30 or $40 an hour.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	I, I want a career that I'd be able to support a family on.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	'Cause I don't have a family, but when I do, I don't wanna have to say, ""Oh, dad has to have five jobs so he can make sure that, he's working every day.""   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	No, it's just ...   Interviewer:	Right.   Interviewee:	[inaudible 01:08:12] The career that I'm going to is not by, is by choice, not existing, like, you know, after I get out of college. So, but just the point that I have a four year degree ...   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Goes a long way. People look at that and they say ""You went to school for something.""   //Interviewer:	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, thank you. That's pretty much the questions that I have. Um, I'm also just curious as to what motivated or interested you to participate in the study.   Interviewee:	Um, again, this is gonna sounds selfish ...   Interviewer:	(laughs)   Interviewee:	And I'm sorry for saying this, but I saw that there was a monetary reward ...   Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And I am pressed for cash, so I need to get things for my family for Christmas.   Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).   Interviewee:	That and I just like talking with people about my opinion. Like I like learning what other people have going on in their lives, like who they are, wh- what they do, like I, I've been interested recently in trying to get into like, journalism after I get out of college, like-   Interviewer:	Oh cool.   Interviewee:	Trying to get a job doing news stuff, because I don't know, I, I love finding out where people are from. Like my girlfriend finds it weird but whenever we're taking an Uber or a Lyft I usually try to talk to the people. A lot of them are immigrants and I ask them where they're from, I ask them how long they've been in America, what they think about being in America. Because, you know, the, the experience of other people is important to understanding who you are and who the world is. "

He mentioned an off campus job, but just in passing, and mentioned at the end that he thought there should be more financial aid offered. //    QUOTES: Interviewer:	If you could put in charge of the academic program at Kenyon, if you had complete control. What are three changes that you would like to make?  Interviewee:	I think one change would definitely be um... so, we have like diversification requirements and for the fine arts one you have to pay to take like uh... if you want learn how... if you have to take... if you want to take instrument lesson, you have to pay for that. Or there are some art classes, you have to pay for those. So, I mean if you can't afford to pay for those you kind of stuck with taking the art history classes or something like that. So, I would change that, you know, that would be included in tuition.    	Um... another thing I would change is that you can place out of a language requirement. I would change that. I think you didn't have to take a language. Even though, I placed out of it um... I kind a regret not taking a language. Um... I think it's useful and I think its, I mean uh... something you should do in college.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm.  Interviewee:	Uh... third change um... (click tongue) I think, I think... let me think of a third one. I guess there is only, you have to take like a quantitative reasoning um... you know you take a like one class of that. I think maybe have like... one more... or require an economics course 'cause I found that really, really helpful.  Interviewer:	Okay.  Interviewee:	'cause I know a lot of people who have been taking economics and I think it's uh... is a good thing to learn.   //  Interviewer:	Yeah. Okay. Great. What would you say have been some of your biggest struggles in college?  Interviewee:	Um... I think, just, seeing how wealthy people are and how they have... I mean [inaudible 00:26:11] Kenyon's campus is just uh... you know a lot of my friends have a lot more money than I do and they go do things that maybe I can't do it. So, I think I struggle with that. I struggled a lot with that my freshman year. But, um... I think I still struggle with that a little bit. Seeing how privileged people are.  //  Interviewer:	What do you see as the role of the arts at Kenyon. Or what do you think its role is in the overall college experience?  Interviewee:	Uh... well... well... like I said if I could change one thing, I think it's kind of you have to have money to take anything other than art history or a simple drawing class. Like for photography you have to buy a camera. They don't provide that. Or, if you want to take music lessons you have to buy the instrument and you have to pay for the lessons. So... um... a lot of students can do that. So, I think um...the role is in the Kenyon community. Is that what you asked or what the role is in education?  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm. Yeah.   Interviewee:	I guess if you like explore a side... an art side if you haven't been able to before, I guess.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm  Interviewee:	But, again you have to have the means to do so.  //  Interviewer:	Yeah. Okay. Great. So, I am down to my final two questions. So first, um.. what motivated your interest to participate in our interview today?   Interviewee:	(lip smack) uh... I find uh... I think the college experience has just been very important to me and uh... I like participating in research studies. Like, I actually just for my senior project, I did an oral history so I was looking for people to participate in my uh...  Interviewer:	Oh okay.  Interviewee:	...project. And uh... I also have a job with the Chicago White Sox where I do fan research and it's hard to get participates so I always like to help out research for research sake.  //  (from interview notes:) At the end of the interview (I unfortunately  had turned off the recorders), he also expressed his views on financial aid – he wishes that the endowment  was bigger so that more first-gen and low SES students had the opportunity to come to Kenyon but knows  that this is a difficult ask, and that the school will continue to take applicants who can pay the full tuition.  //  RECORDS TURNED OFF, BUT CONTINUED:  One thing I would say is – I know it’s hard with college endowments   Make college more accessible to first generation students and people coming from low SES backgrounds  Kenyon says they’re need blind, but I know they’re not   They’re going to take more students who can pay more money  "

And we tried to talk to them a couple times, and they were receptive, but they were just faking. The things that they told us didn't make sense whatsoever. They said, the financial aid officer told my dad, she was like, ""You have to re-mortgage your house, take money out of your social security. Figure it out. Get so many loans."" Because it's $63,000 a year, and then my dad was like, ""Okay. You can't start out with... "" My family's pretty well off, we're upper middle class, we live comfortably. And then she said, ""Honestly, if you make more than 80K a year, you're not gonna be getting very much financial aid."" Which is ridiculous to me, because even if you make $100,000 a year and $63,000 of that is going to an education, $30,000 of that is going to taxes, you have nothing left for a family of four. And so, that was really hard. And then at the same time, we were also talking with Kenyon and Grinnell College about financial aid stuff. And Kenyon was just, I mean the experience that we had... When my parents went through everything, compiled a whole budget report from the last five years, they wanted to show like, ""We don't know how this process works, but this is what our monetary situation is right now, we can't afford this much,"" or whatever.

So when I was a freshman, it was never quiet on weekends.    0:36:30 S1: Mm-hmm.    0:36:31 S2: Well, maybe on Sunday, but usually, Friday and Saturday and then everybody wants to go out, and I would just really... I really just would rather stay in, watch a movie, chillax. I just didn't like... Granted I've always been okay with, ""Yeah, you guys can go do that and I would do something else."" But there's still like that pressure. And when you're there... And when you're not there, you have your ability to just call the shots. So it was just a lot... I just prefer it, but on that same note, I do like the convenience. Or I did like the convenience of being like, ""Oh, I can wake up 10 minutes before my class."" It was a really rough day. You put something on and just head to class and still be on time. Whereas it's no longer the case. Granted my drive is like 10 minutes, but I'd still have to park and then walk.    0:37:37 S1: Right.    0:37:38 S2: Since my metabolism, I've noticed, it's started to slow down, it's probably better. [chuckle]    0:37:43 S1: Okay. Do you feel like you miss anything by commuting to campus?     0:37:55 S2: I think I missed... I thought about this a lot, I feel like I miss a lot of things by not being directly on campus, because then I have to rely on what's online, or like every email I get. But it's been more than that, because I do all my financial stuff, I pay for everything here. I'm not reliable on my parents, so I have to work all the time. So I work weekends, which is when everybody hangs out. So my social life doesn't match up [laughter] to the average college.    0:38:36 S1: Okay.    0:38:38 S2: But I do have my classmates and I have my friends that I was able to secure when I went abroad, 'cause obviously I couldn't work when I was abroad, so that was really nice. So then I got exposed to what typically happens when you're on a college campus all the time. So I feel like I may be partly missed many of those connections I could have made, but I've made up for it in the different jobs that I have and things like that.    0:39:05 S1: Yeah.    0:39:06 S2: But still...    0:39:07 S1: Okay. What do you do for work?     0:39:11 S2: So I go home, and I'm like a specialist at Apple. And here, I'm a mentor. I'm one of the mentors for the Connect group that I mentioned earlier, and I've been doing...    0:39:25 S1: The Connect? The program called Connect?     0:39:28 S2: Mm-hmm.    0:39:29 S1: Okay.    0:39:29 S2: And then I'm a writing assistant at the writing center. And those are what I'm doing now.    0:39:38 S1: Okay. And how many hours would you say, you work?     0:39:42 S2: Anywhere between 27 and 30.  //  1:02:08 S1: Okay, great. What role do you think that UNH experience most prepares you for in the future?     1:02:22 S2: I think my personal drive, and UNH just happens to help with that.    1:02:26 S1: What does?     1:02:27 S2: Prepares... My personal drive. And my personal, like, own responsibilities that differ from most other people's. Typically what happens is that you're very like full-time student, but because of my situation, I'm a full-time student, and a full-time employee. So that has had a huge influence on how I assess situations, and... I don't know, my overall patience with things. And I think I'm very... The way I think is far more... I don't know, maybe mature? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm a 40-year-old, in a 21-year-old's body.    1:03:16 S1: Yeah.    1:03:17 S2: And I think that's because of having to balance my very realistic work life and then my school life, because like with work comes like paying bills and so forth. Where most students, they're really never really exposed to that. So like, even with my roommate, such as I love her, there's still a completely different way with how we process things, and how we think things.  //  1:04:40 S2: Well, I've done orientation for... I did it for two years, and I'll be doing a different part of it this year. And typically what... Oh, and then Connect, I talk to parents at the very beginning before they drop their kids off. They're mostly concerned about their kids not forgetting about them, and making sure they have resources, that their kids can find if they're not doing well in a class. But in many... In the case of the Connect students, they're very concerned, like, ""Where does my kid go if they're having trouble?"" And then, in like general population, they seem to be more concerned about, ""Well, I hope my kid does really well, since this is like quite the investment.""  //"

I think, today, the culture is you need to go to college or you're a failure. But for a lot of people, it's not necessary, and it's sometimes not beneficial. I mean, there's financial aid programs, but for a lot of people, it's a financial burden that doesn't really yield the economic results that any business transaction would. There's obviously a lot of intangibles that go into a college education that you're paying for. You're paying for the experience, for the environment, for all the extra curriculars and stuff. So, I mean, if you take advantage of those, even if monetarily, it doesn't come back as a return on your investment, then that's good. But some people don't need that.

Additionally, he cares deeply about the financial needs of others, and talks a good deal about affordability. On the border with HIGH. // QUOTES: So, I chose Ohio State primarily for its political science program as well as in-state tuition. I was planning at the time to go to law school after graduation. So, I needed to prioritize affordability but Ohio state also had a fantastic and very well recognized political science program. So, I thought the quality for the dollar at Ohio State was really unmatched and that's what got me here. // Um, I think uh, proximity to friends is a fantastic one and particularly the way that that's facilitated with your freshman year floor. Um, it provides a built in social network uh, that I think really helps students ease the transition into college. And I actually opted to stay on campus for a second year um, in part to get that benefit and in part because um, the off campus market can be a little messier. Um, you have to get your lease pretty early, you have to wrangle with rent and utilities and um, and a landlord who... might not be the most responsive um, so having the university as a landlord is a... another perk and one of the reasons I decided to stay on. // Interviewer:	Um, and what would you say is your favorite campus activity? What have you enjoyed the most?    Interviewee:	Um... well I would have to say the student government cause that's where I've invested most of my time. Um, I've uh, I've spent probably over the last two years in particular, 20 to 25 hours a week on student government activities. But I feel like the work is really impactful. We've managed to send some policies through the university senate that have really uh, really changed the game undergraduate students. We passed one on textbook affordability, we passed a big one on mental health resources um, and to know that... to know that that work on investing into the organization is going back and helping my classmates, opening doors for students that might not otherwise be there. Uh, I feel like it's been a very rewarding way to spend my time. // Interviewee:	So um, the biggest challenge is affordability and um, this is a problem that's certainly echoed at universities across the country. We've had... we've had modest increases in state support but uh, still significantly lower than uh, the funding we were receiving pre-recession. Um, and that's been a struggle for the university to close the gap, particularly while controlling tuition. We have managed to hold down in-state tuition, we've had a freeze for the last five years.    	Uh, but the consequence from that has been that costs have risen rather quickly in other areas. International students had their fees doubled last year. Out-of-state students have seen very steady rate increases, housing and dining plans have gone up. Um, and the number of course fees, where you'll just be billed for enrolling in a particular course um, have increased I think by a factor of four um, in the last four years.    	So, um we in student government will refer to it as nickel and diming, essentially when the university can't... when the university can't get revenue out of the main sources being the state government or the base tuition rate, a lot of those secondary fees start to creep up. We've actually reached a point where for incoming freshman, if you're an in-state freshman the tuition bill is less than half of your total cost. Those secondary fees are actually sitting at about 51%, um so I think the affordability challenge has been the big one because it's so consequential to our students uh, in terms of the debt that you carry upon graduation and the uh, the... the steps you have to take even to afford to pay the bill. Um, and its... there's not an easy answer either. // The third one I'll put is to get a job. Um, obviously college is a big financial venture and particularly if you're in debt you need to get that return on investment. Um, I rank it below the skills though, below the content area and the perspectives um, because um, the job really comes out of that, it comes out of your mastery in your major and it comes out of the worldly informed perspective that you can bring and that companies need.

More administration, more support staff.    	And it's it's less of, to me, the the most important thing trustees could be doing to expand diversity of of the wealth of intellectuals across the campus, would be pouring money into the financial aid program and be looking at, you know ... How can we get very interesting people from, extremely different backgrounds to come to Kenyon.    	And right now, it seems to me that we're simply making the place more expensive, and the financial backing is there. And again Kenyon has proven very generous to me. I cannot complain. But, that's not always the case. I think there's this tendency to award a certain sort of intellectuals. If you're good at taking tests.

Still, close to high. //     QUOTES: It all came down to one factor, which was a merit scholarship. So I was offered the Robertson Scholarship here, and that's full tuition, pays all the costs of college and then it also offers dual enrollment at UNC, so I have access to the resources, faculties, students of two universities and it's on someone else's dime. // I think there's some courses that have sort of developed for people to check off those boxes that I told you about earlier, and so they might be a course in a certain department. So you could be... There's a class called like ""The Dynamic Earth"". And it's an Earth Science course and there's geology, but everyone knows it as Rocks-for-Jocks. And so it's kind of a joke class that you take that's easy and knocks up that requirement and then you don't really end up learning anything, so it's just a waste of time. So I think that the University should be more mindful of the consequences first of those policies that make people take courses in these other departments, and the incentives that are created to make these sort of easy classes that allow people to check off those boxes. But students should also realize that the cost, the average cost that you spend just per hour in a class in a lecture hall is a Broadway show ticket.

And there were a few very wealthy people, and a few poor people, but it was kind of middle class. And here there are people who are from very low income, but there are a lot of people who've come from prep schools, and places of elite private education for all their lives. And that's been eye-opening for me to think that... I don't know, places with... That here in America, there are students who have been going to... Their parents who were spending 40,000 a year to send their children to elite schools, and can we really say that we have a meritocracy when successful people won't allow their children to fail? So that's really that I've been thinking about a lot, and that what I... Just real quickly, there's a guy on the floor below me who was caught smoking marijuana, smoking weed, and his family's name is on one of the buildings here.

Why do you think parents send their sons and daughters to college?    Interviewee:	I think parents send their sons and daughters to college because it’s the new norm.  And they want their kids to get a good job.  And I know that’s really vague, but I don’t feel like it’s – it’s not easy to look a parent in the eye and say, “Great.  You just spent $100,000.00 at your – ” or however much money it is, depending on what college you go to – “educating your child.  And you know what?  They don’t really have a job right now.”  It’s – I feel like it’s kind of hard to look a parent in the eye and say, “You know, the most important aspect of college is your child’s intellectual, personal, and social development” – things like that.  That just sounds ridiculous. //"

Uh-huh.  Okay.  Do you think it's important to go to college?    Interviewee:	I do.  I think that in many ways it's becoming harder too, though.  I look at a school like Tufts, and even a lot of public universities out there, it's so much money.  And I think it's important, but I also can't blame people who decide not to, because of the financial burden.    I think that there's a huge issue when it comes to student debt.  And I think that, in general, the United States approach to college education is a really broken system and doesn't properly emphasize the value of a college education, I think, puts a huge burden on students financially, which I think then puts a burden on the economy.  // A lot of it always comes down to issues of funding ___________.  I strongly believe that if something is important to you and if you're saying something is important, you can find the funds.  A very large university that spends a lot of money on a lot of things, and the administrators will say something is important, but they don't have the funding.  But, at the end of the day, if something really is important, you can find the funding for it.// As someone who is majoring in one of the liberal arts in the social sciences, I do have my doubts about how much value I'm getting for the amount of money it cost to go to an institution like this.  I don't think that that's specifically related to Tufts.  I think that's a wider criticism of the higher education institutions and the fact that lots of times we're learning information that's really interesting, but may not necessarily help us in our careers.//"

Also discussed Tufts endowment, which his mother manages, and how the divestment push would decrease her salary.  Also works six days per week and talks about the impact of that on his social life and college decisions. //      QUOTES: So tell me, I guess to start off, a little bit about Tufts and why you chose to come here.    0:00:33 Speaker 2: Well, I guess the first reason I chose to come here is because my mom works here.    0:00:38 S1: Oh, okay.    0:00:39 S2: And I'd been going to private school for six years before that, boarding school, actually. So and then I could be close to home. And it also meant that we could get tuition remission which is really huge.    0:00:50 S1: That's huge!    0:00:51 S2: Yeah. Because now, my mom was able to buy us a new house, which was...    0:00:56 S1: Oh my God.    0:00:56 Speaker 3: Oh, awesome.    0:00:56 S2: Yeah.    0:00:57 S1: Nice. That's great [chuckle]    0:00:59 S2: So, feeling good about that.  //  0:01:04 S1: That's awesome. So did you apply anywhere else or was it just like really...    0:01:07 S2: Yeah, I applied to 12 different schools, but Tufts is definitely my first choice. I applied early. And I mean so far, it's really lived up to expectations, I suppose. For being I guess a faculty child, I had spent surprisingly little time on campus or really around the school, so yeah, I was coming in with kind of more hearing stuff from my mom, and then seeing it here... And it's, I guess, interesting to see how some of her perceptions about the school are fact and some of them are maybe what she sees as someone in her position.    0:01:54 S1: Like what types of things? This is actually exactly what we're interested in. So I'm like, we're like, ""Wow!"" [chuckle]    0:01:59 S2: So my mom works for the endowment, and she's basically in charge of investing their money and making as much of a return she can. And that's actually the basis she gets paid on. So recently, there's been a movement to di...    0:02:14 S1: To divest... Yeah! We've been hearing so much about it, we saw all the chalk. We've been hearing about it and they just chose to divest from those. The students...    0:02:22 S2: Well, the referendum said the students wanted to.    0:02:26 S1: But they don't actually have to do anything.    0:02:27 S2: No, they don't. And what I think a lot of people don't understand is everybody in my mom's office is paid a bonus based on how well the endowment does, so if they divest from profitable investments, that's money out of their pockets.    0:02:42 S3: Wow.    0:02:42 S2: Not... Yeah.    0:02:43 S3: That has certainly not come up. That's huge.    0:02:45 S1: That's huge. I don't... Do the students really understand what they're voting for?    0:02:49 S2: No...    0:02:50 S1: Or they just hear...    0:02:50 S2: They just hear, ""Oh, we should divest and then... ""    0:02:53 S3: And then they do it?    0:02:53 S2: Yeah. And I mean, it's something that I don't really want to move against as a freshman, but something that at the same time, self-interest kind of tells me that I should...    0:03:01 S1: Hits it right at home... So, wow... I wonder if this school's actually... I was wondering if this school was actually gonna to do it, 'cause there's...    0:03:10 S2: I don't think so...    0:03:11 S1: I don't think... Yeah.    0:03:11 S2: I mean, if you think that Tufts is one of the most expensive schools to go to in the country already, and there are a lot of kids here paying full tuition, and this is another thing. We don't have a lot of money as an institution. It's managed really well, and that's why we get the beautiful campus, we get the great academic programs and everything. But overall, we don't have the same endowment per student as like Ivy League schools, or even in Amherst or a Williams. So for us, I don't think it... I mean morally it may be a good option, but it's not practical to do right now.  //  0:03:57 S1: Could the college experience been different than what you expected it to be?    0:04:02 S2: I mean... Yes and no. So I came from two very small boarding schools. I've been going to boarding school since I was 13. I went to an all-boys middle school, and then a co-ed boarding high school. But that was only about 500 kids. So coming to a campus and a population of this size is definitely different. As far as drugs and alcohol, I've never come into contact with any of that at boarding school and that was more of a personal choice than anything. I don't drink, I don't do any of that, so it was definitely something I was able to stay away from. But here, it's a lot more a part of the culture.    0:04:45 S1: Yeah.    0:04:46 S2: And I don't try to put my choices on other people. I feel like that wouldn't be fair, because I'm in kind of a unique situation. I'm an athlete, and right now, I work six days a week. So it's one of those things where I don't think that's the right decision for me, but for some people, it may be something they can afford to get away with.  //  0:44:46 S1: How do you think the students here at Tufts might be different from the students at other schools, in how that they lead their lives?    0:44:54 S2: Well, it's a very accepting, progressive school. And that's good in some ways and bad in some ways. Like socially, I would say, I'm a very liberal person. I'll accept any group of people for who they are as long as what they do doesn't hurt me directly. But economically, it can be very, very difficult. I think that the... There's this Tufts view that... And it's... I don't wanna call it socialism 'cause that's overly complicating it but there's this Tufts view that the playing field should always be level. Right? There's this idea that everybody should be starting from an equal point. And the reality is, the world doesn't work that way. People would always have advantages over you. I'll never be as good a basketball player as Michael Jordan. I'm not built for basketball. Like it's...    0:46:01 S2: I think there's this kind of naive belief that we should try to give everybody an equal chance. And the reality is when you try to do that, you just wind up giving unequal chances to people who don't deserve them, right? I mean, this is very ""Atlas Shrugged"" but you make your opportunities in the world. You are what you do with yourself. And sometimes, you get screwed over. That's just the reality. And if we try to prevent or compensate everybody who's ever gotten screwed over, all we wind up doing is taking opportunities away from people who might deserve them.    0:46:44 S1: And in what ways is Tufts doing this? Like I don't...    0:46:47 S2: So we had this discussion about technology, bio-technology in my Spanish class, and the person leading the discussion was talking about the availability of technology to... So, a little background, this guy had an eye implant that basically allowed him to hear colors, so he was color blind but he would hear a musical tone every, like for every color, so like blue would have a specific tone, red would have a different one. So he would understand what color things were even though he couldn't see them. And her point, or what she was trying to say was like, ""This technology should be made available to everybody at the same time."" And I was like, ""Well, no."" You know what I mean? You can't say, ""It's not fair"" because we don't really have a reference point for fair. And in the same way that, I did this psych study, and it was all about people's views on affirmative action and they were talking about our beliefs about opportunity and affirmative action, and I felt like it was just really kind of one-sided. And every psychology study I've taken part in, every discussion I've kind of had with people in the institution, it seems like there's this idea of, I guess, I would call it ""over equality"".    0:48:24 S1: Like tilting it to completely opposite direction?    0:48:26 S2: Yeah, exactly. And this is something that's been reflected in my conversations with my mom, and it's made for some really interesting discussions. But I don't know... There's this sense here that everything needs to be totally even all the time, and I don't think that's right.    0:48:52 S1: What do you think the students that have been affected by this... What do you think it's gonna be like for them when they go out into the real world and Tufts isn't there?    0:49:02 S2: I think it's gonna be a real freaking wake up call. That's the biggest problem I have with it is, if college is supposed to prepare us for life, it's... Part of life is getting screwed over and if you're not ready for that, then you're not gonna be able to handle it once adversity comes knocking.    0:49:21 S1: And in what ways does Tufts level the playing field? Do you just mean financially or in acceptance? Or is it like...    0:49:27 S2: Well no, not... I believe that you should give people financial aid and you should accept people regardless of their race but it's not specific actions taken, but it's more of an attitude. I feel like... And this is gonna sound awful but...    0:49:50 S1: No, we're curious.    0:49:51 S2: I feel like there's a lot... The attitude towards students of minorities is a lot more apologetic than it would be towards a student like me.  //  What about career-wise? Do you have any idea of what type of work you wanna do? Or what you want...    0:42:02 S2: I love what I do now. I have the best job in the world even though I get yelled at sometimes, but most of the time, I have the best job in the world. It's really cool to... I'm just at the point now, I've been working for about five months so that the numbers that I brought in when I started working there, or now...    0:42:20 S1: They must be really changing now.    0:42:21 S2: Yeah, exactly. You're starting to see their bodies changing. But the cool thing is their mentality, like the confidence they have, the way they carry themselves is so different, and like, I don't know. I mean, if I had $40 a month left over, it would go to a gym membership, like if that was the only income I made. Because...    0:42:41 S1: It costs more than $40 to have a personal trainer, right?    0:42:44 S2: Well, I teach classes.    0:42:45 S1: Oh you teach classes? Oh, okay.    0:42:46 S2: Yeah. That was actually the biggest personal change that I experienced this summer is, I was an 18-year-old kid just out of high school growing up and trying to tell 30 and 40-year-olds how to move. And that was like, if you go up there and you're not confident, it's gonna show, so you just have to really...    0:43:06 S1: Just go for it. Do it.    0:43:07 S2: Go for it, yeah. And yeah, I mean... I'm really, I just think that gifting... No matter what I do, like, no matter how much people pay me or my boss pays me, fitness is such a... It's a thing that so many people aspire to, but so few people understand. People don't understand the amount of work it takes. People don't understand the amount of time. But if you can invest it and if you can help people get there, they achieve something that they never thought they could. And that's the really cool thing is when you see a light go on in someone's head, and they're like, ""Oh my gosh! I can do this."" You know what I mean? Like I can...    0:43:54 S1: You can lift that next couple of weights, yeah.    0:43:59 S2: I can lift that weight, yeah. But even... So CrossFit there's a lot of like very complicated movements. It's a lot of Olympic weightlifting, it's a lot of fast movements with the barbell. And when you hear a mom who's 35 and just in the supermarket, thinking about how she can improve her clean and jerk, that's special. You know what I mean? And the other really cool thing is it teaches people to, that instead of looking at working out for the way they look, it's performance. It's how much weight can you lift? How fast can you run? And that's like, especially younger girls, I think, really could use CrossFit because, you just hear so many girls say, ""Oh I just wanna be skinny."" No, that's not like... Skinny isn't healthy. Healthy is strong. Your body is an instrument, not an ornament.  //  What do you think parents would say? What do you think parents want for their students when they send them here?    0:53:13 S2: Well, first and foremost, I think they want to feel like they're getting their money's worth.  //  And are there any parts that we have... Maybe that you'd like to talk about that we haven't touched upon? Are there any questions that you think we should have been asking you?    0:57:17 S2: I guess, I'm in a little bit of a unique situation, because I work.    0:57:21 S1: Yeah.    0:57:22 S2: And that, I feel like, makes me... It almost accelerates me on the road towards adulthood, more than other people.    0:57:34 S1: It does.    0:57:34 S2: And I find that that's one of the biggest things that separates me from other people. So in the future, if you talk to a student who works a job, especially off campus, touch on that because that's something that has a pretty interesting social effect.    0:57:54 S3: What do you think the social effect is for you?    0:57:58 S2: Just when other people are out partying, I need to tone it down. I can't stay out 'til 2:00 in the morning on Friday night, 'cause I wake up at 7:00 on Saturday morning.    0:58:07 S1: Yeah, and then you have to teach a workout class. [chuckle]    0:58:11 S2: Yeah, it's the toughest thing I've ever had to juggle in my life, is on the one hand, being a student, being new, being young and I almost feel 10 years older when I go to work, because of the responsibility. And it's like a whole different weight on my shoulders than I think my peers have.   //"

So, tell me, do you think it's important for people to go to college?     0:12:12 S2: Oh, God! This is such a tricky question. [chuckle]    0:12:15 S1: And designed to be.    0:12:19 S2: So, I'm gonna say yes because my family is very, very... It's like just an assumption that all of us are gonna go to college and pursue graduate education and just keep studying for decades and decades.    [chuckle]    0:12:38 S2: That was the thing. But now, the more I've really come to realize, that I, of course, feel, in this day and age you absolutely need at least a bachelor's degree to do anything. You need something to lean back on, because like if you're just gonna be cruise... I mean obviously, there's exceptions like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and who not, to that kind of take away from what I'm saying, but in, I feel like 50 years from now, if all else fails, you need something to lean back on. But then again, I feel like there are so many people that have learning disabilities and are not in financial situations where they can afford it, or need to take care of their family, or their kids, or... There's so many different situations and those people have found a way to make a living for themselves, go to nursing school instead, make their own startup company, so many different outlets that have created a path for them.    0:13:50 S2: And I think when you look at all those stories, it's definitely feasible to not have... It's definitely possible to not have it and to just rely on your skill sets and you life experience education. But I would say that, 70% say that it is [chuckle] important to have a college education.  //  0:34:00 S1: I have heard... Yeah, that's great. Okay. So we've been talking mainly about positive things, but from your perspective, what are the biggest problems on your college campus?     0:34:13 S2: So I think we do have a fair amount of people from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, but otherwise, I feel like it's a pretty homogeneous student body, because everyone... Not everyone... But like, I feel like a very, very good chunk of our student body is from middle to upper, to very, very wealthy, in that range. And that socioeconomic status. And because of that, like everyone is super smart, super rich and because of that, I think people are very privileged here. So I wouldn't say that's something that's totally negative because like I said, like I've met some of the nicest people ever and one of my best friends, like grew up in the Upper East Side of New York City, but she is like the most self-aware person I know. But I definitely think that, that it is slightly one of our weaknesses because, I feel like we do have diversity but it's kind of hiding.    0:35:39 S1: Mm-hmm. And what do you think that you're missing out on, by that lack of diversity or lack of tangible diversity in the student body?     0:35:45 S2: So I don't really mean ethnic diversity in this situation, because I feel like we do definitely have a lot of that, but I think it kind of causes a lot of social anxiety for others. Not, not so much for myself, but from what I've spoken to, with some of my other friends. It makes it really difficult for some of my guy friends who wanted to rush frats, but can't afford their dues anymore. That type of thing.  //  1:00:11 S1: Right.

Um, whereas I don't think teaching is a job, or at least I don't think it being a job is necessarily the primary reason a teacher teaches. And I don't mean to suggest that every administrator is an administrator just 'cause it's a job. I, I know a lot that are like, that really believe in it.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Uh, but I think that maybe they lose sight of the objectives of the university because they're a bit more distanced from the actual academic experience.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, so, so for those reasons, I do think that maybe an administrator would value that a bit higher. Um, but at the same time, I mean, I, I'd be surprised if any of them said anything on there doesn't belong or definitely should be in the bottom, the way I kind of, (laughs), disregarded to get a job. Um, you know, I mean, those are all important, and I'm sure administrators would say the same thing. But, you know, with that, with that change that I mentioned.    Interviewer:	Okay. And then lastly, what about parents?    Interviewee:	Um, parents I'm sure would say to get a job, would be, I, I'm sure most parents would say to get a job is the biggest reason to go to college-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Uh, because again, I mean, that's kind of how it's, it's sort of sold to, to us, uh, us being, I don't know, people in general, uh, in America at least, um, is that, you know, sort of college opens you up to opportunities to get a job, and, and parents in a large way, I think they're, they're, they're concerned for their child's ability to be, you know, uh, financially independent, which I think then would also speak to, to learn to live independently.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	I, (laughs), I'm sure a lot of parents, (laughs), are like, ""Get off to college, 'cause I don't wanna, you know, I don't want you to be dependent on me anymore.""

Interviewee:	Um, (laughs), I would, uh, I would just like to talk with as many students, well not as many, because I would like to go in depth, (laughs), but I would, I would like to just walk around and have a lot of conversations with people. I mean, I know that, uh, the library's great. I mean, I love the university library, so actually, I probably would spend some time there. I used to work in the library on campus, and so I've like perused those shelves hundreds, probably thousands of times."" // ""Interviewer:	The way it came through. Um, so if you wouldn't mind telling me sort of what's your number one concern, and then on down through five. Um, so one would be-    Interviewee:	Okay.    Interviewer:	The most important concern, and five is the least.    Interviewee:	Now, just to clarify-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Is this for me, from my experience, or is this more like a, what I feel is the bigger concerns, uh, in university as a whole?    Interviewer:	Um, I think it would be a little bit more from your perspective, um, specifically talking about-    Interviewee:	Okay.    Interviewer:	Sort of DePaul and what you see as the biggest issues on DePaul's campus.    Interviewee:	I see, I see.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Um, okay. So, there's five, right?    Interviewer:	Yes.    Interviewee:	[inaudible 00:42:40].    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, and one is the biggest concern?    Interviewer:	Yes, it is.    Interviewee:	[inaudible 00:42:48], okay. Let me just look through this.    Interviewer:	Sure. I can figure out how to get out of my full screen here, (laughs).    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, I think that, uh, number one is mental health issues.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Um, number two would be alcohol and substance abuse.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Uh, three is relationships with peers.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, actually you know what, I would bump safety issues up to three. Relationships with peers the four, and then academic dishonesty at five.    Interviewer:	Okay, perfect. Um, okay. So, can you walk me through a little bit why you chose that particular ordering?    Interviewee:	Yeah. Um, so I think that mental health issues, uh, number one, just from both my own experience just as a student over the years, um, that has been probably one of the largest challenges for me. Um, just I think that, um, especially just because I feel like more and more is being asked of students. Um, I know a large part, I think that's because of the rising cost of education, just worrying about, like if you have to go to class, and then on top of that, you have to balance a job, or maybe two jobs, or I know students that even have two and a half or three, um, and then on top of that, you know, you have your academic studies outside of being in class, uh, and then you wanna be involved in something on campus, um, and then there's social aspects, um, you wanna enjoy your life, (laughs), you know, on top of everything.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	I think that there's just such an overwhelming, um, burden placed on students that it, it's kind of increased, I, I suspect, the amount of mental stress that's placed on students, and I think that, that, that manifests in the form of different, you know, uh, mental health issues, whether it be anxiety or depression, um, or anything else. And, um, I just think that students, um, I think it's experienced by a lot of students. And while there are resources available, um, it still seems like a very prevalent issue, so it would be good to see that continually addressed in new ways. I mean, I think that just telling students that, ""Hey, we have, you know, counselors here that you can see throughout your year,"" um, I don't think that that necessar-, I think that's great for some students, and I've even benefited from that in the past, but I think that that, that's, um, not every student is gonna embrace that, and so maybe there's other ways, uh, to reach out and, and support students, um, through, through all that.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, so that's why I think that's the biggest."" // ""Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay, great. Um, okay. So, let's see. Um, what do you feel like are the benefits of living on a college campus? And, um, you don't live on campus, I'm assuming?    Interviewee:	Uh, I don't right now, but I-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	But I did live on campus, uh, my first two years, my freshman and sophomore year, I, I lived on campus, yeah. Um, so the question is the benefits of that?    Interviewer:	Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, I think that, I mean, probably the most obvious, or at least it's the most obvious to me is just the, uh, proximity to, to the classrooms. Uh, you know, it's, it's never an issue, it was never an issue for those years, uh, either making it to class or getting to the library whenever I wanted to study, um, and also just being around other students. Um, I think it helps, especially in those early years, like that first year, it helps to be in campus housing because you kind of see everybody's in the same boat, and everybody's kind of trying to figure out sort of the same thing, uh, in that transition, and everybody's coming from different experiences. You know, some people have, maybe have older siblings who have been to college, so they kind of know the ropes, or maybe they went to a, a, you know, a high school that prepared them in a different way. Um, so it kind of just, it was nice to kind of be with, uh, sort of a, a, a cohort of my peers in a, in a living environment-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	That was on, on campus.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	I, I really enjoyed living on campus.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Aside from the cost of it, which is probably half the reason I stopped living on campus, as well as the fact that DePaul just has very limited, you know, campus housing because it's right in the middle of the city. Um, if it weren't for that, I probably would've continued to live on campus, 'cause I, I really loved it.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	You know? It was nice to just be around the school."" // ""Interviewer:	Okay, great. And let's see, so maybe you could tell me about um, why you chose DePaul over other schools that you might have been thinking about?    Interviewee:	Sure. Um, I didn't, at the time that I was applying to universities when I was 18, um, I didn't really have, uh, a clear, uh, passion for any one subject or any university. I didn't, I wasn't overly committed anywhere, uh, but I knew I wanted to stay in Chicago, so I just applied to a handful of Chicago schools.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And, um, after I was accepted to DePaul, I visited the campus for the first time, and I just got a good feel on the campus, and honestly didn't even visit any other campuses after that. I said, um, and I just, I kind of had a, sort of an intuition about it. I also felt like, you know, a lot of, I understood at that time that a lot of the university experience would be whatever I made out of it, so I didn't feel like committing to one campus or another was going to kind of be the end all, be all of it. Um, so I didn't feel too hesitant in just going, ""You know what, this feels right. I'm gonna go with it."" So-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	After visiting DePaul, I just was like, I like this. Uh, they offered me a, a decent amount of scholarship that I could, you know, afford to do it, and-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, yeah. That was, that was why I made the decision. There wasn't a whole lot behind it other than it was one of the few schools I applied to, and I got a good feelings about it."""

Also talks about state allocated funds to UNH and how they are low, as well as how the arts are always underfunded.]// 0:02:05 S1: UNH offered me the far superior financial package, and when it came down to it I had already worked a lot with music at UNH. Through their Summer Youth Music School. So I actually decided then I was going to come into UNH as a music major. And over the course of the last four years I have now decided that is what I want to do, so I'm going to pursue it whether it works out the way I want it to or not. So that was kind of how I came to UNH even though it was originally at the bottom of my list and to be completely honest it's probably one of the best strange decisions that I ever made.//0:10:46 S1: Within the academics however, this might be music major specific, but we have a lot of drama within the music department, even as well departmental drama, is another thing that pops up. Other big problems that I've noticed really are just, you can get a lot of... Being on campus means that I'm more attuned to what's going on throughout the campus, and what's going on all the time. If I were commuting, I probably wouldn't know quite as much, about such politics and everything that's going on with the university or the president and everything, and maybe not even on the state level about university funding, and everything. And that kind of just creates an external problem I think, because the arts are always underfunded, and I think we might have been popped off this list, popped off the top of this list, but UNH has the wonderful distinction of being the least state-funded public school in the country.    0:12:06 S2: Yeah.    0:12:07 S1: And I think they just doubled it, but it was originally just last year at 6%, I think, state funding, which is awful.    0:12:15 S2: Yeah, it's an expensive public college.    0:12:19 S1: Yeah, I think we have the highest state tuition in the country. And that one I think is gonna take a while to get... To come down off of. And so having those financial issues obviously, of living on campus, where you have to pay more, and then having the stress of that hanging over you sometimes, and it can tinge some of the experience that I've had. It makes me feel... Like one of the more recent controversies that really hit me hard was, I've always been a little iffy when it comes to sports funding versus arts funding, because it always feels like there's too much on one end and not enough on the other from my own personal viewpoint. Obviously I'm biased, so...    0:13:03 S1: But we have an athletic fee at the university, a part of which does go directly into scholarships for athletes. And I know that created a lot of tension on campus, and a lot of problems arose out of that just because a lot of people were upset. The fact that some of their money that they were paying every year was going to someone else's scholarship, whereas academic... We're talking like full ride scholarships, whereas the highest academic scholarship we offer at the university is the Governor's Scholarship, of $16,000 a year, which covers in-state tuition more or less. But it's only afforded to one person every year. The highest outside of that is only $4,000 a year. So it's a pretty big... It was a pretty big deal for everyone to have to understand that.    0:14:05 S2: Had to swallow that, yeah.    0:14:07 S1: Large group of... And I mean we're all very proud of our athletic teams.

Um, and it's a beautiful structure, and the students who are in that college really benefit for ... That's why we actually have some really strong business students who have high grades, and that's why if you're not in the [Hall 00:14:07] College and try to transfer your major into there-    ... you almost can't, because the s- the GPA just to transfer is 3.5.

Honestly, professors need to stop being allowed to sell their own personal textbooks, like things that they have published, to their students, like forcing them to buy. That happens a lot and I just, I know it happens in other universities, too, so I'm not like slamming UNH for it, and I know pretty most colleges do it. I really don't like that professors do that. They're basically making money off of their students, and how much money students already have to pay to go to college, I don't think that's fair. I think that there are plenty of resources for a professor to put on a great class without ever having to use something they've ever published, and they also can do it without having to make them buy the whole book, you know? Publish an art- or print out an article, but especially since it's your book. I think it's, it's controversial but I think it's something that academic programs ...// Um, concerns at UNH. As I said, infrastructure is a big one. I think UNH really needs to improve its infrastructure. Um, and I think a lot of it has to do with we don't get enough money. Um. Right now the university, the way its financial system's set up, because the state of New Hampshire doesn't support us at all, we're really riding on the backs of students to pay for projects. And it's, it's expensive. That and we're riding the backs of alumni who were generous to donate lots of money. Um. That's how the [Peter Paul Hall 00:19:00] was built.    And I, that's a system that isn't sustainable, um, so I'm really work-, that's something I'm really concerned about with UNH. Will we have the buildings and infrastructure to actually be able to support 13-15,000 students over the coming years?    Um, and I would hate to have to see this, the university have to take steps with like, shrinking how many students we bring in every year just because we can't fit them or because there's not enough building space.    'Cause I think what the p-, the human capital we have here on campus is fantastic. I think we have a great community of people, that as long as we have the space and the resources to do stuff, I think this is a great university that does great things. Um.

So, I got a full scholarship to Duke, so that helped me. I was looking between Princeton and Duke and Chapel Hill. I had gotten full scholarship at each of those to UNC and Duke. And then for me... So it was just between Duke and Princeton, and I think both of those schools are phenomenal, there's no doubt about it and Princeton is also great. But for me to graduate without debt, even though my parents paid for my brother in full and were happy to pay for me. I am fortunate enough that I can say that I'm from a family that can afford that. But for me to be able to graduate without debt meant a lot to myself, it meant a lot to my own autonomy.    0:03:11 S2: So, I wanted to pursue the scholarship route, because I can say that, I did this on my own. So, that's why I picked Duke  //  0:20:37 S2: Exactly. So part of it is teaching you how to think. And then, the other part, like I said, is trying to figure out what you wanna do. But, as a senior, I figured out that that question is a very poorly-worded question that we often throw out to everyone. So, ""What do you wanna do?"" is such a hard question to know. It's a hard answer to have at the age of 18 or 22. And, most likely, what you're gonna do in life, there's not, none of that is, the majority of things you're gonna do in life haven't been invented. And many people change careers. So, I think college is to help you figure out what you're interested in and where you might wanna go afterward. But it's hard to have that perspective when you've also got the job market and the looming economic crisis.  //  0:50:02 S2: I would give everyone $1000 to do something to improve Duke. I would give them the week off to do it. I would encourage them to collaborate and they can pool together their money.

It's a long history, it's partially race, it's partially economic, it's a lot of other factors. But I wanted to have that impact and so I worked with... I helped start this group called the 'Community Empowerment Fund'. It existed in Chapel Hill and in my first year at Duke as a freshman, it was also its first year at Duke. And basically we work with people who are low income, people who are temporarily homeless and we help them find jobs or build resumes or help them save money or budget. It's just a cool way to get out in Durham and meet people and people that are often marginalized, who can benefit greatly just by, you'd be surprised, just by you talking to them and getting to know them.

I don't know. Everyone on Tufts' campus, it's a very like hypersensitive campus when it comes to, uh, race, politics, uh, you know, sexual assault, um, religion, just like kind of the inter, um, those inter-student conflicts. Um, since there are so many ... there's such a diverse student body of people  coming from different backgrounds that are naturally just going to be more passionate about fighting for one cause or another. Um, it really ... sometimes it does create for extremely polarizing environment.    Um, and for instance around like the Israel Palestine conflict, um, there are ... there's a huge Palestine community but also there is a massive, uh, Jewish community on campus and, um, POEL has a very big presence on Tufts' campus. And when both groups of students are very passionate and, um, passionate about their side of the issue, it creates a lot of tension between students.    And I find myself not really identifying with either side of a lot of these more polarizing conflicts of being just kind of like a, you know, a middle class white kid, um, from, you know, American white kid really not being able to identify as being a person of color, of being an international student, of being a person with a disability, um, but of me who just kind of rides a pretty smooth line of being able to go about my day not having to worry about, um, you know, maybe a lot of these issues that other students are very passionate about.    So I wouldn't say ... maybe that's not like a bad thing about our campus, but it definitely just ... it creates some hostile tensions amongst the student body, because people just ... there is a diversity of students and people are passionate about it, their in-group. // Um, yeah. And the study sounded interesting. College has been a like super and integral part of who I am right now and I wouldn't trade it in for anything, no matter how many, how much, uh, student debt I have right now.

If you are going to college because you want a job from it, there are specific majors you should be in, and specific majors that you shouldn’t be in.

I always underestimated myself and like... I guess, when I came here, one of my goals was to really try, like really... Sure, there's theater, sure there's this and such, but my priority right now should be and actually really is academics. I'm at one of the best universities in the country. It's a shame not to take advantage of the resources.    0:25:55 S2: My goal...

I mean, even though I wish it wasn't, you do go to college so that you can get a job. You go to college and you learn and you study and you major and you go to graduate school, so that some place can hire you for what you know and for what you can contribute. And I think that's what it is. There's certain credentials you just need to have in order to get a job. A lot of places will not hire you if you don't have a college education. A lot of people won't hire you unless you, I don't know, have this resume to show, have your GPA from college to show, have your this and that. So yeah, no, I think it's the most important thing.

High school, I really didn't get to do that, and I feel like it'd be difficult to do that if you weren't in somewhere like college where like... Because I'm a psychology major, I have ten classes I have to take in order to fulfill that major. So I'm gonna be studying everywhere from... Not even what I wanna do which is abnormal psych. I'm doing abnormal, social, clinical, music, therapeutic... All this kind of stuff. So I'm going into this content of psychology in extreme depth for the entirety of my college experience. And I don't think I would get that anywhere else, I don't... Unless I just went on Google for like a year and studied something.    0:40:22 S1: Like, over a year?     0:40:23 S2: Right? Yeah.    0:40:26 S1: And then, so to gain different perspectives and knowledge people in the world?     0:40:29 S2: Yeah. Definitely. I mean, there's so many people I have met here that I just haven't... It was so cool. I had never met people or been friends with people from Mississippi, Louisiana... I never had friends from Hawaii, I never had friends from Dubai and Turkey and... You just learn so much more. And I guess, in high school, I never really knew about... There weren't many things that were stressed about like different types of social disorders and autism and sexual harassment and all that kind of stuff, and these are all issues that I've faced while being here. It's completely changed how I react and respond to things like when people say, ""That's retarded."" People would say that in high school all the time. And now that I've met people who have autism here or Asperger's and have been able to come to college in Tufts, it's... I hate when people say that.    0:41:30 S2: Okay. It's just not... I think I think a certain way, and then I go to this debate and I end up changing what I think, and it's all because people here are willing to talk, and aren't forcing their decisions on you. But because they're just so passionate about what it is, I'm able to kind of re-scope and rethink. And sometimes I maintain my own views, or I meet someone and they're not the way that I thought they'd be and I kind of don't really change after meeting them. But, I've had such cool, new experiences.    0:42:04 S1: And do you think that's something that you could have had happen if you hadn't come to college?     0:42:08 S2: No. I really don't. I guess, the ease. It's not... I guess, I could but it's not as easy. I mean here there's just like a pool of people from different places around the world. I met a circus performer. A kid who loves... I've never... It's like... Yeah. So, definitely to gain different perspectives. And then the fourth one, to live independently. And I'm not living independently right now. I still... My parents are paying for things, and sure, I'm more independent than I was, like I do my own laundry all the time. I have to keep my room clean. I get to kind of choose where I want to go and...    0:42:46 S1: So what's the distinction between having to get yourself up for class and feed yourself, do your own laundry, and supporting yourself financially?     0:42:54 S2: It's huge. The difference is huge. I mean, I don't consider myself as really living that independently right now, because I'm not supporting myself. I'm not living independently. I'm living dependently. I depend on my parents. And I guess, that might also come from the fact that I'm so close that I feel not...    0:43:12 S1: This is..., yeah.    0:43:13 S2: Right. But I guess the part that I do feel independent about is like, I get to make my own decisions. I get to choose... My parents don't have to know what I did Saturday night or Friday night. And that's fine because it's finally a time where I get to do... Experience and explore something... And things I didn't get to experience in high school. You know?     0:43:36 S1: Yeah. It's a growing thing.    0:43:37 S2: Yes, it is. But yeah, no, there is a huge difference between doing my laundry and getting to go into the city for a day without my parents knowing...    0:43:44 S1: No one's actually explained that difference. It was interesting to hear you actually articulate it.    0:43:49 S2: Yeah. It's very different.    0:43:50 S1: I thought about that. It's like, well, wait 'til you get out of college.    0:43:53 S2: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. It's... I saw this girl here named Genesis. She... This girl has supported herself. I heard her story at one of the panels. And even recently on Facebook, she put on this message, ""I need $2,000 to travel abroad. All of my stuff got... "" whatever. And the community helped raise money for her. That was incredible, because it showed me how... Her parents... She's paying for her own college tuition, and she's gotten so much aid, which is great, but I would consider that as living independently too, because she is supporting herself. She has jobs outside of campus.    0:44:35 S1: Jobs.    0:44:36 S2: Yeah. That's a huge difference than making myself dinner one night. There's no... There's definitely no denying...    0:44:43 S1: There's no comparison.    0:44:44 S2: Yeah, that's why I'd put it as number four, if that makes sense.  //  0:53:09 S1: And what about parents? Why do you think parents send their sons and daughters off to college?     0:53:16 S2: To get an education, to get a very very strong education, so that they can hopefully get a great job and succeed. And make money and live a lavish life whatever that means, it can be completely subjective. Whether that's just to live comfortably or to live happily, and not have to worry.  //  0:54:28 S1: What do you think about the board of trustees? What do you think their goals are for students?     0:54:32 S2: Well, this is gonna sound really... No, I'm not gonna... I would tell, maybe hopefully be... To hopefully be in a position where they could possibly be a board of trustee. I don't know. It's like to... I don't know. The board of trustees donate however... They're very involved in life because they give money to the school, right? And like, is that the...    0:54:57 S1: They kind of... I don't know if they give money to the school, but they kind of are in-charge of the general trust of the school and making sure that financially, the school's in good shape. And then thinking about as an institution, making sure that things are running the way it should be, whatever they...    0:55:15 S2: Yeah. I guess, then, just investing things that will benefit the students. Like, the addition to the library or a new building for biology or whatever it is. I think, that's what it is, I guess then. Help benefiting the students.  //"
831,P133,School 3,Medium Importance,Seniors,"MEDIUM IMPORTANCE: RATIONALE: Another code that isn't quite as clear -- this participant talks about the financial struggles that the general student population faces, but in terms of her own financial situation, I'm not sure that it impacts her on a day-to-day basis or shapes her college experience. She is more concerned about finances in terms of making others aware about different socioeconomic brackets. // QUOTES: Um ... I would say being more socially aware. Um, I think this conventional and traditional education um, means, really means nothing if you have not understood the realities of different people, um. There's tons of people that are just like in their own little bubble, but their perfect little world, you know with like parents that pay for everything and like, it's just not like that. And like, if it's like that for some students, like that's great because they don't have to worry about some things, right?    But like, just being conscious. Being conscious of like all the different things that students and just people in general have to face, uh. And I guess putting that stuff into perspective when it comes to actually like judging someone. Um, I don't know, I don't know how to summarize that but just like just knowing, you know? Just being conscious and I guess more, more connected to like each other. // Interviewee:	Yeah, that, um. I studied abroad my freshman year, I went to Greece, um, which has been completely eye opening. Um, to be the first of my family to leave the country um, on my own. So that uh, I would definitely do that again. Uh, with all the resources, that means I wouldn't have to worry about the funds or about paying for that or having loans to pay for that so that would just be great. // Interviewee:	Um, so there has been a great commotion about that, um. Uh, and DePaul has been acting on it but they have been acting on that because the push that we have triggered, um. I was in the protests, I had been like at almost all the protests I think. Um, and I'll be getting like much, so many criticisms you know, like ""You shouldn't be protesting,"" like, ""It's free speech."" But this whole year has been dedicated to speaking about race at DePaul, which would never have happened if we had not acted, um.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And so because of that, departments are hosting these um, department, um these events and then um, just like the higher ups, you know? So, I, I think that that's the main concern, um. Aside from that, tuition is very pricey um, if you are eligible for FAFSA, then like, that helps a lot. I know without FAFSA I wouldn't, probably wouldn't be at DePaul. There's no way to come up with like $40,000 on my own (laughs).    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, but for students who are undocumented who cannot get FAFSA, what you know, like where, where do they stand? Like just scholarships? Like, and I know it's doable, it sucks, it's so mentally draining for them to do that and so um. And again, undocumented students are mostly, not all, but they're mostly latinos.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	So, again, it goes back to like the use of [inaudible 00:41:05] set, we're not really made to fit everyone. // Interviewee:	Um, I think although students um, like although students, some students um, have to grow up really fast because of their parents' socioeconomic status um, although they have to grow up really fast in like high school or middle school sometimes, when you're in college we have, with documents such as FERPA, you know? Things where your parents cannot have input at all, that's you without them. Um, and I know my mom hates when I say that I don't need her for certain things but the truth is I can sign off for myself now, so (laughs). // I do think it's important. Um, I know there's a strong cultural impact on whether or not uh, we find it beneficial or not. So, for instance, I know for- So, I'm a first generation student so for parents who migrate here, they have this vision of the American dream but I feel or like, I've discovered and learned, I don't know, that this quote unquote American Dream is their way of like aiming to being accepted to like the white society. Um, and so obviously it's, it's a way of assimilation. It's a way of seeing like, education isn't the only way out kind of?    Um, but personally I don't, I know, I know that getting into higher, like getting a higher education is not the easiest and much less like, what you have, like people are currently homeless. So, that's [inaudible 00:09:43] to make sure that everyone can reach them and so with that, I know there's, there's a lot of young people that are just like discouraged like, they just don't see themselves at college. Um, and so, it's not the only way out, or not the only way to success actually. Um, keeping in mind that success is different by everyone, like in different terms. So, we did, it's- N- I- I- I personally don't think there's a standard definition of success, um. It's just whatever you want it to be, um.              "
986,P005,School 9,Low Importance,Seniors,"LOW IMPORTANCE: RATIONALE: He describes UNH as affordable but expensive for in-state, and has some complaints about how tuition is being used. His personal financial situation is never mentioned. // QUOTES: Being a psych major, I like to find out where people came from and how they got to where they are, so I would definitely utilize those types of things.  I'd probably go check out more – probably I'd go to the Hood House, which they have study abroad stuff there and advising there, and grants and stuff, funding opportunities for research. // Interviewee:	I think it's very similar to the administration.  It's their job to run things from a business perspective, and to make big decisions on that.  The only time you hear about them is when they do something that makes people unhappy.    Interviewer:	What types of things?    Interviewee:	Like raise tuition or cut a service that our school uses, or UNH was going to draw up a ton of money, I don't even know the number, but changing our logo over the summer, and they wanted students' opinions, and all that did was piss students off that we were spending all this money to change something that didn't really need to be changed, in our eyes.    Interviewer:	Yeah.  What did they wanna change – you guys are the Wildcats, right?    Interviewee:	Yeah.  They didn't wanna change our mascot.    Interviewer:	Oh.    Interviewee:	They want to change the official logo stamp on a letterhead.  Because right now it's Thompson Hall, it's a picture of the top of the tower.  They wanna change it to include the letters ""UNH"" in it.    	They wanted to make it like a U with New Hampshire inscribed inside, or something like that, to kinda – because one, we're more than just Durham campus, and Thompson Hall is a landmark of the Durham campus.      	But we now have a Manchester campus, so they wanted to kinda encompass all of it, and UNH students were like, ""No, we don't like change.  We like it the way –"" just a simple little logo was like, they were gonna drop like $250,000.00 to hire this super high-end New York marketing company that does this for big corporations and organizations.    	We were like, ""We don't want that.""  So those are the kind of decisions that they make and that we hear about.  Also, to be on board with I think like cultural change and community change.  I know this, being in the research lab I'm in, where we have researchers who are into community intervention and prevention and awareness programs for violence and stuff like that.    	They take these things, these programs that they need funding for, to them, mainly because they run the money.  So I feel like to them it's they are running a business that happens to be in education, to a board of trustee member, kinda like with the president or that type of administrative position.  They're running the business side of things.  They're not doing the educating. // 	So I think we're just – what makes UNH different?  We have a lot of kids who work hard.  I think you see that.  We have a lot of people who – it's a state school, so we have a lot of people from New Hampshire, and because it's affordable for them to come here instead of out of state, even though it's a pretty expensive in-state school.

Um, it was the cheapest, and- or one of the cheaper in-state options. Um, and I was given, uh, a decent amount of financial aid that made it possible for me to attend. // Interviewer:	Or try to. Well, that's really awesome. Do you find that there are any sort of resources for someone who, um, is the first generation at UNH, or ... Have you been-  Interviewee:	Um, there's scholarships, but there's nothing that's really, um, aimed at first generation students. The hardest thing, honestly, getting into is a random schedule, um, billing, and academic stuff. Like, they say throughout high school, college is harder, college is harder.

Do you have any, uh, id- it's probably hard to answer, but any idea what sort of support you wish were in place, or-   Interviewee:	Um, yeah, I wish there was more, um, more of a resource to tell kind of like, when things are gonna, like, what you need to prepare for, um, when things need to get done, like, they have the general kind of, uh, announcements of what needs to get done. But for doing it for that first time, for my parents it was very confusing. All the paperwork, how everything works.

Okay. Um, and in thinking about your work and your school, is there anything that keeps you up at night to worry about?

Great. So tell me, when it was time to think about applying to schools, what made you choose UNH over any other school?     00:49 S2: Honestly, what made me choose it was the view. I was actually riding the train, I had a girlfriend who lived in Maine. So, I took the train up and down towards Maine and UNH is one of the stops. So, one day I just got off by myself and I just walked around the campus and I fell in love with the way the campus looked.    01:08 S1: Yep.    01:09 S2: So I just said, ""You know, maybe I should apply and see what happens.""

Alright. I'm gonna go back the original question, I got sidetracked 'cause I thought that was such an interesting point. When we ask faculty what the goals of the college experience are, what do you think the typical faculty member would say?     47:28 S2: The typical faculty member, I would think they would definitely still say is to get your degree. But I think in my experience, what a lot of professors would say is to experience the field that you're studying but experience it in a different way, if that makes sense. A lot of my professors really advocated for me to do the Budapest program which I was really, really like up to, but I didn't have the finances to travel abroad.  //  49:47 S1: How about give me both answers.    49:49 S2: Well I think if they were talking to me, they would probably say you know, like as a trustee like we're here because we obviously fund the school, so we want to see you do a lot more than just... Because they pay for more to you to just go to class. Like all of the things that, like the memorial union building, all these things that we have on campus like they help fund those things, so for them it would be, like they would tell me, like, yeah we want you to get your education and do well but we want to see what you can bring to our university, like what can you do for me since I'm funding? But I think what they would say to just the general public is like, yes, we want all of our students to get a degree but we also want them to experience studying abroad or we want them to experience the different clubs and organizations. I don't think trustees have any clue about some of the organizations here at all. But I think they would have to say those things to help recruit and get more funding into the school.  //  "
LASCAP 0832,P066,School 6,Medium Importance,Seniors,"MEDIUM: RATIONALE: Mentions finances a few times throughout. Never in a deep way, but finances have impacted his decision-making, and are a main reason he is at OSU. // QUOTES: [Right, okay. Um, so when you were looking to choose a school, why did you end up choosing OSU over other places that you might have applied to or were looking at?]    So, the main reason was really just money. Um, OSU was not really my first choice.    But it ended up being really the only choice, based on scholarships... So, for me, it really was ... It really was about the money. I mean, I knew OSU was a good school, so I didn't have qualms about coming here.    There were just other ones that I had originally wanted to go to more.    But the scholarship money was ... It just didn't make it even a question in my mind. I knew I had to come here. // As they stand right now or as they stood?    [Um, actually, if you could talk about what you came in thinking were your goals, and then if they changed, and what you're thinking about now.]    Okay. Yeah. Um. Yeah. Okay. So um, I think it was safe to say that, coming into college, I was definitely on the track of wanting to do something that would make sure I had enough to live on, and live on comfortably.    Um, and the focus wasn't as much on doing something that I really wanted to do for the rest of my life.    Or even the thought of exploring different options for careers wasn't really on my radar.    It was more of just like, find out what will give me a good starting salary and where I could advance, and then move towards that.    Uh, and then, as I started to study more and get into classes and I realized that ... and I really wasn't ... I don't ... I'm not drawn to most of the things now that most people coming out of college get really great-paying careers with. I mean ...    I'm a social science person, so I like ideas and people.    And I really had to do a paradigm shift where I was like ""Hey, I can't do something that I'm not going to love for the rest of my life, even if it's going to pay me really well.""    So I think that was something that I went through my freshman year and I was still figuring out a little bit my sophomore year, and it was exactly ... Not only what I wanted to do, but why I wanted to do that.    For those things.    Um. So, and that's why, I mean ... I think I had to fill this out in the, um, survey before, uh, you contacted me, but I'm a philosophy and public management, leadership, and policy major.    And those things are not necessarily big money makers, so ...    Um. You know, realizing that, first it was philosophy and then it was the public policy stuff. Government, those things, which I love, but I had to realize I ... You know, I needed to be prepared to not make as much as a lot of my friends and my peers who, you know, were coming out with engineering degrees. But I was also okay with that, because I also realized that I was able to do, and will be able to do a lot of things that they-    Can't. Aren't comfortable with, and, you know, they don't have as many skills that are necessarily as applicable to as wide a range of things-    As maybe I do. // I mean, if you need it to show that you got a grade, I kind of think that's a little bit ridiculous.    I mean, you're- you're wasting your money, your time, and your energy, so I think if you're going to be doing that anyway, using those kind of techniques would help a lot because it would better allow the students to really ... I think really understand what they're being taught and really learn to apply that, um, to other areas and not just the immediate class or field that they're in, so ... // I think, um, one, the proximity to the university and just being in the midst of everything I loved and, honestly, if it was less expensive, I would probably still be doing it. // A lot of freshmen, they still, I think ... There's still that, like, tension between knowing that they're here for school and they're at an amazing university and they need to take this seriously and yet, you know, that adjustment period of, you know, I still want to go out and do these things because I'm away from my parents. Or it's just new or different or whatnot, so that I think is definitely something that I would like to see change over time. Um. I think, again, going back to some stuff, I said earlier, I think a lot of students who come in are still kind of in this mentality of not really learning, just because they want to learn, but learning as a means to an end of like, a large salary or, you know, whatever it might be, but they're not ... There's less of an emphasis on learning for the sake of learning-    And more emphasis on like, achieving great things, um, getting, you know, a fantastic salary, um, or just generally, I think a lot of freshmen don't know what they really want to do and they ... They have to go through more of an adjustment than I did, maybe and the ... They haven't really had to ask that question of like, do I really see myself doing what I think I might want to do for the rest of my life? And then when they actually go into their major and declare, they're struggling because they really don't know, and they haven't experienced it before.    But they do it anyway because they're like, ""Oh, I mean, it's going to get me a good salary and I'll just kind of push myself through whether it kills me or not or if I really do well or not."" So. Um, that's one thing, I guess. And then even, I guess the last thing would be, it's just a large university. Which is great, and I mean, it's awesome. //   Interviewer:  Yeah, no, that's great. Um. Okay, so did you ever live on campus as a student?    Interviewee:  I did. Freshman year.    Interviewer:  Okay. What did you think were some of the main benefits for you for living on your college campus?

He also mentions not going to grad school right away so he can pay off his undergrad debt. // QUOTES: 0:02:48 S2: Yeah. Well, I did very, very well in high school and actually got into all of the schools I wanted including Middlebury and BU, and all those places, but financially, those were impossible.

Is there anything distinctive about the UNH educational program that attracted you to the campus or was it primarily just the financials?     0:03:48 S2: No, actually it... The Keene and UNH were basically the same financially. I don't know. I just liked the feel and I had a few friends at UNH. So I came and visited a few times. Yeah, I just liked the feel of the big school as opposed to the small school, I guess. Once I came and visited here, I realized that Keene was almost identical to my high school. You knew everybody. Yeah. So I just liked how this felt. So, honestly, I kind of came here on a whim and it turned out being the best decision I've made. // 0:07:25 S1: And what types of things do you think need to happen, or what types of things do you think need to be in place in order for you to realize these new goals?     0:07:37 S2: Well, one, I need to take care of some undergraduate debt that I've collected before I pursue a graduate degree. I don't wanna end up in a pit of debt. And otherwise, I think if I were to have applied to graduate programs this past semester and getting accepted into them, I think I would have gotten accepted because I've made extremely good personal connections with countless of mentors I've used, and excelled academically and have definitely gone above and beyond what was asked of me here. Whether it's doing an extra project in class or whether it's representing UNH at the New England Shakespeare conference. // 0:15:16 S2: I guess just starting from the beginning like Gen Ed. Or like the big things here. Or I guess, since I'm a transfer student I followed the Gen Ed. System. I guess other kids follow the discovery program system, which are practically the same things with different name. I think some of the stuff is valuable, like the language requirements that I think almost nearly every major has. I think that is something phenomenal just 'cause then that... Even just like a year of it will at least help you to speak it partially. So, I love that aspect of it. I definitely would say that I have wasted a good chunk of money on some of the Gen Eds that I was required to take. // 0:16:24 S2: I took... I had to take a math class. I guess this one was more geared for ""English"" people, or like COLA, College of the Liberal Arts People.    0:16:38 S1: What was that like?     0:16:39 S2: It was pretty much a joke. The math we were learning was really easy, and... I don't know. I think on that exit survey for that class, 'cause I kinda wrote, ""If we were going to learn simpler math like this, we should at least learn math that is applicable to real life."" Like I said, ""Really, I would have rather taken a class on how to do your own taxes.""    0:17:14 S1: Yeah. That would actually be helpful.    0:17:16 S2: Really, because that would be like, ""Okay. I could use that some day.""    0:17:22 S1: Or like personal finance or something. Something other than...    0:17:25 S2: Yeah, absolutely. But a class like that which is offered here, personal finance I know is a class, but that's, you can't take that as a Gen Ed. I guess opening up what can be accounted as a Gen Ed. Class... // 0:19:22 S1: Exactly. [chuckle] So what types of... So we talked about some of the classes that maybe you would change, some of the things we would change. Is there anything that you would keep the same?     0:19:39 S2: I love the variety of abroad programs that they offer.    0:19:44 S1: Okay, tell me about that.    0:19:46 S2: I know through basically every... Regardless of what your major is, within that major there's always opportunity to go abroad. I myself was never able to go abroad. I just couldn't financially do it. Even though when you go tuition is the same, room and board is never the same.    0:20:08 S1: That's true.    0:20:09 S2: Plus, spending cost and all of that. Either way, I wasn't able to study over there. But everyone who I know who has, that's always the first thing they talk about. And I just think that's a very awesome, awesome experience. My girlfriend, for instance, lived in Spain, Grenada, Spain for nine months. And learning about that culture, just you could see see how much it's affected her. I don't know. She's become worldly, I guess. And it gave her an opportunity to utilize those six years of Spanish she took and now she's fluent and all of that.    0:20:59 S1: That's so cool.    0:21:01 S2: Good experience all around, and that's gonna help her get a job. It's already helped her get an internship this summer.    0:21:08 S1: Wow.    0:21:10 S2: Which is great. Well, she's an occupational therapy major and the camp she's working at, the fact that she's bilingual put her in a very nice position in that camp.    0:21:22 S1: It really is always such a bonus. You always...    0:21:25 S2: Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I wish I was as versed. I can speak it, but not as fast as she does. // 0:29:46 S2: And it's all over the media as well.    0:29:48 S1: Yeah, all they wanna do is talk about and it's...    0:29:50 S2: It's all those commercials and it's brilliant marketing on their point. A school make a trillion dollars because they're not having to pay nearly as much because everything's just online.    0:30:02 S1: Yeah, they don't pay for buildings, they don't have to pay for dorms.    0:30:05 S2: Exactly, it's like ""Oh, this is a way to make a billion dollars really easy."" But what kind of education are you gaining from that?     0:30:15 S1: Yeah. No I...    0:30:17 S2: Maybe it's for people that need it, that accommodate the people that work all day. But also when they get their degree and it takes them six years online, that's amazing. But if you have the opportunity, please don't do that.              "

Um, ASAP is a program where they provide you with um, vouchers for books, metro cards, and um, daily advisement. And I felt like that was a real big help because, you know, as you know the cost of living in New York are already crazy.

I don't think that it's important to get a job and be just stuck with that job for the next 50 years. Times have changed. So, it's generational conflict. So, different generations are going to have different, uh, topics that they think is important.    Like, the Boomer generation, is okay with just a high school diploma. They worked in good jobs with their high school diplomas, but that's not the case nowadays. The Millennials Generation has a lot more economic hurdles to pass    Cause the jobs aren't here anymore.

Well, I've always read about college in the news and how the national level and different states deal with college education and the fact that there's 1.4 million ... trillion dollars in student debt, sorry. And, uh, it was interest me the debate between the boomer generation and the millennial generation about the role of college because they went to school for free, while we don't go to school for free. Um, and we get called lazy and all these different labels that they attach to us. So, learning about colleges has always been ... Learning in college is also in the classrooms but also outside the classrooms.// I feel like the experiences I had working for an NGO kind of prepares me for the inevitability of what I would face. But at the same time, it's like, thinking of raising funds and keeping me going, is something that really daunts me. I'm very active in the UN and it kind of, like ... They have changed the policy for admittance, like, they used to, they used to have a lot of civil society members participate in their meetings. But now, it's more restricted to people who have the blue pass.

LAS1785,P044,School 4,High Importance,Freshmen,"HIGH: RATIONALE: On the lower end of high - the participant organically mentions finances at the end of the interview and discusses how the price of college is important. A big factor in the overall experience. // QUOTES: 00:35 S1: And why did you choose Duke over any other schools that you might have been considering?     00:41 S2: Merit scholarships. // 00:43 S1: Was there anything about why you applied to Duke versus other schools? Was there anything distinctive about the types of schools you were looking for, or the types of educational program that you were interested in?     00:55 S2: Yeah, so I was looking for private research institutions, mostly. Actually, yeah, most of the schools I applied to would fit into that category. And I thought for what I wanna major in, neuroscience, and especially biomedical sciences, Duke certainly has one of the strongest programs. That with the community and the merit scholarships, I think Duke easily became my number one choice. // 02:46 S1: Now thinking about the greater purpose of college, what are your main goals for your college experience?     02:56 S2: So, I think obviously one of the differences between high school and college is the level of resources that we have access to...    03:02 S1: I'm sorry, it cut out a little at the end.    03:05 S2: Oh sorry, the resources we have access to. So, I mean, I went to a public high school, our educational budget I think was between $30 and $40 million for the entire district, but at Duke it's a $7 billion endowment. So, I think for me, one of the biggest things is to take advantage of all the resources and the opportunities, especially the faculty on campus. So, I guess I wanna learn, to put it simply. And the other thing that's important is, as well as to prepare me for a good career. Personally I wanna be a doctor, so preparing me for the rigors of medical school and beyond is definitely important.    03:47 S1: And what types of things need to happen, or need to be in place in order for you to be able to realize these goals?     03:55 S2: So, I think one of the biggest things for me is advising, honestly. I think it's beneficial to have people who understand the process of going from 18-year-old, just graduated from high school to becoming a doctor. Obviously the four years in college, there must be a lot that happens, so really just understanding that process and not having to worry about sort of maneuvering it, I think is one of the most important things that Duke could offer. // 20:50 S1: What are some of the resources, programs, activities at the school that help students make the most of their experience?     21:00 S2: So, I think one of the biggest things I feel that Duke does, is that it's like a year round experience. I know a lot of people who have things going on over the summer that are directly through Duke programs, whether it's studying abroad in one of the summer sessions. Like I'm going to Oxford next summer session, too.    21:17 S1: Cool.    21:18 S2: Yeah so those kinds of experiences, but also the opportunity to just do research here at Duke, to connect with other labs internationally, to go travel in a variety of countries to perform research. So, I think Duke offers a way to be all year round with your education, so you don't lose touch over the summer. I mean, I know some of my friends who go to other schools... I don't know if it's their fault or if it's the schools, but they'll come home and bang out like four different shows over the summer on Netflix, versus a lot of Duke students who go out and do something for three months. You know?     21:53 S1: Yeah, it keeps you in... Keeps that flexible.    21:56 S2: Yeah, and you learn throughout the year. Well, I mean, like while we do have obligations to real life in our classes, it's more theoretical, it's more academic in the classroom, but then over the summer you can apply, you can directly apply what you learn in classrooms for the past year. I think that's one of the most interesting things that Duke does, that they give you a lot of opportunities, and they're not... I don't think they're cost prohibitive either. Most of them are free. Duke gives out a lot of grants, I think, so... // 49:37 S1: And then is there anything that we haven't talked about that you think we should be asking students about?     49:48 S2: You know what, honestly in the 21st century, considering in the US, I think I would ask about finances honestly. Yeah, like how people see themselves being successful, like how they measure that later on. Like what is the value of their education? Is it worth the money that a lot of people pay? So...    50:10 S1: And what do you think about that?     50:13 S2: I think I'm very, very lucky that Duke offers merit scholarships. Would I have paid the full price? So do I think $250,000 is worth the university education that Duke offers? I think in some perspectives, yes, but I don't know. I don't know, I can't necessarily say that. Like for my state school like UConn is like what, $25,000 a year? So I don't know if paying an extra $35,000 to come to Duke makes sense for everyone, to be honest. I think a lot of people, it doesn't pay off. The price difference doesn't equate to value. And I don't necessarily think that's just a Duke phenomenon. I certainly considered a lot of peer institutions back home and the Ivy League, but I don't think necessarily... I think the price-points are about similar, between 55 to... And Columbia's like $65,000 a year.    51:10 S2: So I don't know that the difference between going to a state school and a private institution is all that's worth it. I think maybe for some people for what you wanna study for like... I think maybe pre-med and neuroscience and math, maybe that kind of education. And I think like better professors more into their class time, more resources is beneficial but for some disciplines, I don't know if it helps that much.    51:33 S1: And what types of disciplines do you think maybe it wouldn't be as big of a deal?     51:38 S2: So I think... Honestly I think a lot of the sciences, to be honest. Like if you just wanna study sciences or if you just wanna study even like economics, I think it's not that important. I think maybe for some of the humanities subjects, for like literature, finding that one rock star professor to be your mentor is very important. I don't know, I'm not a literature major. But from what I've heard from my friends, it's like you find a mentor. And I think for those people, what's interesting too is that a rock star professor doesn't necessarily teach in an elite private institution. So they could be anywhere. So I think for them, it almost matters less, the school. It matters to them specifically faculty, almost like graduate school faculty. So I think... You know what? For a lot of people, they might not assume it makes sense to spend the extra money. 52:36 S1: Yeah. Well we see... Sometimes we like to leave some of these things open, and just kind of see if they come up throughout the interview. But it is a very interesting kind of angle on things right now. It's coming up a lot in the media.    52:49 S2: Yeah. For my high school, we had to do a research project and I did mine on educational forum. Yeah, part of the thing I found is although I know colleges spend a lot of money, college tuition and room and board prices have been beating inflation by significant percentages. So I don't... I can see why some people think it's not a fair tradeoff...    53:13 S1: Yeah. It's definitely a debate that's hot right now.    [chuckle]    53:16 S2: Yeah. And putting yourself... Especially to put yourself in a lot of debt, I don't know if it's worth it in the long run to go to an elite private school that charges $62,000 a year. // "

Like, you're treated like a replaceable employee, and they kind of remind you that if you make any hiccup, any mistake, like if you're like five minutes late, they will cut your throat. It is like, they are not playing with you. But then if the manager's like, an hour late, it's like, oh, you know, it's, it's you see it, and I don't, I didn't like it.    Mmm.

I mean, when you're paying 60 grand for something a year, you wanna know that you're getting something.  So for me, like I'm not really as much focused on getting something as I am on building something from what's available here.  But I think that if you talk to my parents about it, my dad would wanna know about the connections that I make.      	And that's part of the reason that my parents – they're totally happy that I chose Tufts, and they think it's the best place for me.  But I could sense that my dad wanted me to go to Yale because he wanted me to – he just wanted me to meet people there who were gonna be Wall Street bankers and politicians.  And he wanted me to meet girls that I could potentially marry that might be related to the Kennedy's.      	Like that's part of what he wanted because he wants to get his money back.  So I don't know.  I have a feeling that's what parents think about it.  But also, most of our parents went to college, and so they – my dad has stories about how he tried every drug in one night.  And so I'm sure that's part of it.  They want their kids to have a different experience.  And it's probably mostly the financial thing.   // Interviewer:	But for students, what do you think they would say is the goal of the college experience?     Interviewee:	I think most students would say the goal of – that the college experience is to get to a place that's better than where they came from.  Like they see college as – and whether – like for me that's kind of like a philosophical maturity thing.  For others, it might be – especially kids that come from a poor environment, coming from a Jewish family, I totally hear this.  Like there's a reason that lots of Jewish kids become lawyers and doctors and go into politics.      	And that's because their – they've grown up with their parents saying like don't be like your grandmother and your grandfather.  Like study and you'll be happy.  And so I think a lot of them might say college is a way to become wealthy and have a happy life.  But I think we can all agree that college is a way to get someplace better.  But I should stress that college is not the only way to get someplace better.  But it is one way. "

2138,P065,School 9,Medium Importance,Seniors,"MEDIUM IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: The student mentioned finances as a key factor in her decision to attend UNH and mentioned that because of her financial aid, she didn't have to worry about the cost of living on campus, but finances don't come up otherwise.  This was on the border between low and medium. [2015: Was the deciding feature in where she went to college; thinks everyone should live on campus but realizes this is not financially possible for some] //      QUOTES: 0:00:14 S2: Well, I'm from very close by to UNH. I grew up in Kittery Point, Maine. So kind of a tiny town outside of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and I actually had a very weird kind of high school experience because I went to public school in Kittery for a year, and then I transferred to a charter school in Dover, and ended up graduating early from high school and going to college a year early. So, I went to UNH kind of what would have been my senior year of high school.    0:00:52 S1: And how did that... Why did that happen? I mean how... Were you ahead in credits? Was it not challenging enough for you? What was the reasoning behind it?     0:01:07 S2: Yeah it wasn't... High school wasn't really challenging enough. I was kind of bored and which is why I work in admissions at UNH. I think that's why I'm so interested in college admissions now, because the process was really fun for me. I just kind of saw it, I think, as a way to really start the education that I wanted, and I had applied to Phillips Exeter and didn't get in, so I was kind of just bored in high school. I didn't feel like I was being challenged enough, so I decided junior year to do that, and then just took 10 courses in my last semester and just applied to college like normal. I was considered a senior because all my credits were in. I didn't really like skip anything. I didn't do any APs or anything like that. We didn't offer them, so it was pretty easy to get a full course load, and took some online courses from like Brigham Young University, and stuff like that. It was kind of a eclectic process but I applied to UNH, UVM, NYU and Plymouth and Marymount Manhattan, and then ended up coming to UNH.    0:02:24 S1: Okay. Great. And was there anything... I guess why... So why... How did you choose UNH over other schools?     0:02:33 S2: I originally... I mean, I used to talk about this all the time I feel like in Admissions. UNH just wasn't my first choice and I mean, I think it's pretty obvious to see why, because I was from so close by. I mean, my... I could go home for... I can go home for dinner whenever I want. My childhood home is like half an hour away, but after coming to Admitted Students Day... Oops sorry.    0:03:02 S1: You know what? No, that's okay. It's my fault. I'm gonna just unplug this. Okay, sorry.    0:03:10 S2: It's totally fine. After coming to Admitted Students Day and also just getting my financial aid package and compared to what I would paying for other schools, UNH was a no brainer. Also this is before the state 50% budget cut, so I was paying essentially like $3,500 a year for school means that my financial aid has gone up to around $10,000, but, at the time, it was just... I looked at... It was between UNH and Marymount Manhattan, and Marymount was going to be like $17,000 a year, so it was just the kind of thing where, I couldn't not go. And once I went to Admitted Students Day and really like saw it at the campus, it's a very well rounded college. I felt that I would get a really well-rounded college experience going here, and I mean that's absolutely been the case, so...  //  0:23:03 S1: Right. Are there any courses that you've taken that you consider to be ""wastes of time""?     0:23:14 S2: No.    [chuckle]    0:23:14 S2: I just... No I think that... I've heard... My friend Amy was taking Germs 101 last semester and was like, ""I can't believe it. I'm paying for my education and taking a course like this."" And I was like, ""You shouldn't be saying that.""   //  0:34:09 S1: Okay. So switching gears a little bit thinking about campus and campus life. What are some of the benefits do you think of living on a college campus? So you lived very close, yet you chose to live on campus. What are some of the benefits of that?     0:34:26 S2: I think everything. I always say, I give tours and everything. So I'm always like... I know there is always a commuter. Someone who is planning to be a commuter if I'm giving a tour of like 60 people. So I always say, ""You know, campus life is important, but as a commuter you will be a part of the campus too,"" and that's really not true, I don't think. I think that's the one thing that I emphasize that I just know I have to bring it up. But everyone I think should live on campus. But I understand it's, a lot of people it's a financial thing. And so for me I got enough financial aid where it wasn't an issue. And I also... For me, my parents are divorced. Now my mom lives in Florida, my dad lives in Dover, so he still lives very close.  //  0:50:50 S1: Great. If you could advise an incoming freshman, what would be three pieces of advice that would help him or her make the most of his or her college experience?     0:51:03 S2: Wow! I feel like that's a really loaded question and it's something you always see too in those how to, survive college kind of books, but it's just different for everybody. I think what I would say is, I would assume... Assuming that they're living on campus, I would say, try to have a harmonious relationship with your roommate, just be neutral, 'cause things blow up so much because of roommate problems freshman year and it can really distract you from what's really important, which is finding your niche on campus, finding your friends, and most likely a random roommate that you get put in with. I mean, it could be your best friend, but most likely they probably won't be. So I think people focus too much on kind of being isolated in the first group that they're kind of thrown into and I would say, don't do that. Branch out, when you meet your true, always gonna be there for you, college friends that you can talk to about anything, you'll know immediately. Once you find those friends, you're never gonna wanna go home, so that solves that homesick problem. Just find your new family here.    0:52:14 S2: And then I would also say, get your work done ahead of time. I think that's something I still have an issue with, I'm kind of the queen of procrastination, but you get your work done ahead of time it's going to be so much better quality, you're going to get better grades, you're going to feel good about yourself, and you're going to feel like you can really handle college. Pretty much no matter how rigorous the program... I at least that I can only speak from my experience at UNH, cause obviously I've never attended another college, but no matter how rigorous your program, if you give yourself enough time to really work on your work, you're going to be able to do it. It might not be perfect, but you're going to do well. So I think that leaving yourself enough time to do that is good.    0:53:00 S2: And then I would also say, just don't drink too much. I wouldn't say to anybody don't drink at all, 'cause I mean, in a college atmosphere, you probably would, unless it's something that is really important to you, but I would say that it's good to have a balance of social and school life and I think that, that's a really important piece of advice that I think it's really on the extreme sides of the spectrum. People will be like, or parents, or stuff like that. My parents they are like, they didn't, push me either way but I think that people will either say, ""Okay, I have to just do so much work, I have to focus on this"" and then they get burned out and end up drinking too much or they don't have a social life at all, or they get very caught up in their social life and school is not the number one priority. So I think the balance between the two is really important and that's what I would advise somebody going in to it and with my sister, I do. Just make sure that you leave time to enjoy college and life but the reason that you're there and what you're paying, and she's paying way more than me through school. The reason you're paying that much is for your classes and your degree. But you won't enjoy your classes unless you enjoy where you are, so...  //"

Yeah.// 24:26 Interviewee: Second, I'd put 'mental health issues, stress, anxiety, depression, eating disorders.' I think that a lot of people get very stressed out and have a lot of anxiety, because they put too much pressure on themselves. In school here, I've noticed this especially with a lot of my freshman peers, because they will... If they know what their major is, they will hop into courses that they probably should not take until they're older. Or they kind of overload with trying to balance a job with student organizations, with academics and what not. So, I've noticed that a lot of issues with just stress and anxiety, and I think it's just depression that carries over from prior experiences in high school that just hasn't been resolved yet."" // ""53:58 Interviewee: That's a very broad term that I think refers to a very diverse range of subjects that don't get too much focus. Mainly because of their monetary value, as when it comes to careers. Business School, obviously, business is a very, very prevalent part of American ideals, and just America. Health and Sciences is a very complicated realm that requires a lot of attention, and requires a lot of studying. And Computer Science, that's something that requires, and Film, that requires a lot of attention, and artistry. And I think that Liberal Arts is a domain where I think that it almost gets under-credited because I think that some people don't think it requires as much attention as, say, some of those other schools do. But I also think that there's a pattern, too, because there are very, very few majors in the Liberal Arts School that produce jobs that really have that, I don't know, that monetary benefit. Yeah. I guess that's how I kinda classify it."" // ""01:17 Interviewee: I know that I'm gonna be studying in the College of Liberal Arts, so I'd enjoy... Looking through the department, I enjoyed the amount of experience that all the different professors brought to the board, and the fact that I would be able to work within the city, as internship opportunities opened up. And the fact that it was in such a diverse city like Chicago just helped that as well."" // ""31:26 Interviewee: But I think if there is a way in which these issues could really be discussed, I think this also just has to do with the students that go here are so busy because they have to commute between this campus and downtown and home, sometimes. And a lot of the different majors therein have a lot of different outside work or they have internships. And so, because of the amount that students are involved, it is hard to be more focused and concentrated on trying to spread the word and be incredibly vocal about issues like sexual assault or substance abuse. "" // And so being able to see the amount of poverty there is in a city, the amount of wealth there is in a city, the kind of struggles that some people face, the way that different people act, the way that people have to get around"" // ""The one class I took, which was part of my Integration to Chicago or Discover Chicago Initiative, was about food citizenship and it was discussing the amount of access that citizens have in Chicago to get food. It's whether or not they can produce it on their own, how far they have to go to get it, and so, I went all the way from Albany Park, which is probably 15 minutes north of here, all the way into Englewood and Garfield, where it's a lot more impoverished, and saw the difference between a man who has the right to produce his own food, he has this whole garden in his backyard in this small little town flat, with his own goat pen and chickens and stuff, to Englewood, where people will have to go three miles and hop on four different buses in order to go get to a Jewel, or get to a Walmart. Because there's no place where people can get food and where people are limited to potato chips and shitty hot dogs everyday, because it's so poor and no one wants to establish a business there. And so I think that's something that's... That's real shit. And so that's something that I really...

I'm kind of someone who does pretty firmly believe that in general, college is a fun experience and people in general can be happy at most places. So I think relatively speaking, we don't have a terribly large difference. I think that a lot of times, students get a little too obsessed with ""this college yields this salary,"" and all of that.

So-    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... Having, like ... It was just ... I came to Tufts because it was completely different than what, like, my life, I expected it to be.  //  Interviewer:	So, in terms of, um, the- the college experience in general, how do you think it should change you? And in what ways do you hope to stay the same?    Interviewer:	Uh, yeah, with the-    Interviewee:	I hope that ... I- I think that college, the college experience should make you more aware of what the real world has in store.    Interviewer:	Hmm.    Interviewee:	And, like, the ""real world"" is such a cliché, I guess. But, like, more aware of the world from both an international perspective and more aware of just, like, what's facing you when you get out of this little bubble. 'Cause college is a bubble. College is, like ... My friends and I call it, like, a prepaid utopia. 'Cause there's basically-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	(laughs)    Interviewee:	... It's like, there's no rules, there's no, like ... I mean, there's rules, there's, like, things you have to follow. But really, nobody cares what you do during the next four years. Like-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... The cops are on your side, people ... Everybody's on your side in college. Whereas, when you get out-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... It's a dog-eat-dog world.    Interviewer:	Yep.    Interviewee:	And so, I think it should definitely make you prepare for that, a- and it should definitely ... College should be, like, a sobering experience of, like, okay, it's time to, like, become somebody now. Like-    Interviewer:	Hmm.    Interviewee:	... But I think that at the same time, about college you should, you shouldn't think that you're already, like ... That, ""Oh, my youth is done and, like, my ... I'm gonna have to, like, wear a suit and tie every day and go to, go to-""    Interviewer:	(laughs)    Interviewee:	""... clock ... Go to work or whatever."" Like, I think college should still make you ... You should still remember that you have time to explore.  //  Interviewer:	So, are there certain kinds of instruction that are most effective for you learning that you're looking for?    Interviewee:	I don't think so. I mean, I haven't had ... I don't know what o-, what- what other types of instruction there are. I don't like it when they assign you, like, videos to watch. I'd rather be talking to the professor. Or like-    Interviewer:	So, like-    Interviewee:	... Like, there with the professor.    Interviewer:	Say more about this. So, they assign you videos and s-    Interviewee:	No, like, they- they haven't done it yet.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.    Interviewee:	Yeah, but, like-    Interviewer:	Hypothetically.    Interviewee:	... Hypothetically, I wouldn't like it, like, if a professor said, ""Okay, watch these videos and we'll discuss them in class-""    Interviewer:	(laughs)    Interviewee:	... Or whatever. Like, ""No, like, I'm paying you for you to teach me, not for, like, the ... I can find this video online.""    Interviewer:	So, if you were ... Are there any classes that you think you could do that you could do sort of online course work that you would get enough out of, or would you always prefer the professor?    Interviewee:	Um, I mean, you can probably get that out of, like ... Maybe, like, a poli-sci class you could learn a lot.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	But even then, like, poli-sci has a lot of discussions. You have to learn about, like, well, what is this angle of politics? Think about this as you ask the professor questions on it. I think we're paying too much to be, like ... To not have the- the resource in front of us.  //  Interviewer:	Okay. Um, who or what do you think will have the most influence on you while you're in college?    Interviewee:	The job market.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative). Okay.    Interviewer:	How did you-    Interviewer:	Say more.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Yeah, um, so, like ... Oh, actually, you know what? Can we scratch that? It's not the job market.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	It's my parents.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.    Interviewer:	All right. Say more about that.    Interviewee:	Yeah. Um, I mean, I just really want to ... My parents are, like, really happy that I left Texas, and really happy that, like, I'm doing something. My dad didn't go to college.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	My, um, my mom went to grad school, but like I said, in that university, like, that small university.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	So, like, they're really happy that I came over here, and, like, recently my mom sent me, like, a care package and it has a really nice letter, and in it she's like, ""I always wondered what type of boy you were ... What type of man you were gonna grow up to be, and ..."" It's like-    Interviewer:	Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna, like ... Getting choked up right now.    Interviewer:	(laughs) I know.    Interviewee:	(laughs) It's like-    Interviewer:	That's so nice.    Interviewee:	So, like, I just really want to make sure that they're happy with, like, what I major in, and, like, with what I do. So, like-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewer:	Oh. (laughs)    Interviewer:	And you meant it. (laughs)    Interviewer:	(laughs)    Interviewee:	(laughs)    Interviewer:	Um-    Interviewer:	Do you ... Are you, like ... Do you talk to them a lot on the phone and tell them all, like, different things?    Interviewee:	We FaceTime sometimes.    Interviewer:	Oh, you FaceTime?    Interviewee:	Yeah, I mean, like, I also, like, don't talk to them on the phone very much-    Interviewer:	(laughs)    Interviewee:	... Because I'm always busy, but-    Interviewer:	Yeah. You've got a lot-    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	... That you're doing.    Interviewee:	Yeah. Like, my- my classes, like, my elective classes are, like, from 6:30 to 9:00. I have mock trial from, like, 9:00 to 11:00.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	And, so-    Interviewer:	Uh, you said too you wanted your parents to be happy. What's ""happy"" for them? What does sort of your success-    Interviewee:	Hmm.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	... Here mean to them>    Interviewee:	Me doing good. Like, I guess, like, having a good GPA. Having friends.    Interviewer:	Oh, that's nice.    Interviewee:	Basically not flunking ... Or, like, they want me to have, like, a 3.0, around there.    Interviewer:	Oh.    Interviewee:	Like, have a reasonable GPA, be making networking connections.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	They just don't want to see me, like, go back, I guess. They, like, they said, like, you took this step ... Because I gave up a lot. Like, I had to break up with my girlfriend of two years to come over here, and-    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... I had to, like ... I gave up, like, a lot back home to come over here. And, like, a lot of people are just waiting to see me fail, kind of.    Interviewer:	Oh, jeez.    Interviewee:	Yeah. And, so ... Because nobody leaves back home. So, like [crosstalk 00:29:32], the attitude is usually, like ... I have ... There's one person. M- my cousin went to Harvard. And, like, that's the only guy that's ever left from my town. Like, ever.    Interviewer:	Wow.    Interviewee:	So, like, people are just basically waiting. They're, like, ""You're not gonna make it,"" or, ""You're not gonna ...""    Interviewer:	And do they say that? Or is it just a feeling?    Interviewee:	Yeah, like, my ... Like- like ... No, they tell you. Like ... Or, like, or- or l- like, my aunts will be passive-aggressive and they'll be like, ""Oh, you thought you were too good for the University of Texas or whatever?"" Like-    Interviewer:	Wow.    Interviewer:	Wow. Now, did you talk to that cousin that went to Harvard at all? Did you-    Interviewee:	Yeah. We're- we're, like, kind of ... I'm more close with his sister, who's my age, and she-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... Graduated with me. But, like, that cousin is ... Like, he kind of got ... But he was valedictorian, so, like ... Uh, people were, like, expecting him to go-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... Kind of far or whatever. So, when he got accepted to Harvard, he left, and now he graduated, and he's doing really well for himself, so everybody's like, ""Wow, he did really good.""    Interviewer:	Did you get to talk to him at all about this type of, like ... About this iss- ... Did he ... Or did he not face this? Like, have you-    Interviewee:	I don't, I don't think that ... I- I mean, we're not that close. Like-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	He's not, like, out of ... And the only ... Because I mean, he lives in Mass, and I-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	... Live in Texas, so, like, the only way we could communicate was, like, through Facebook-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	... And he didn't really have Facebook after, like, his sophomore year, junior year.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um-    Interviewer:	Did he stay up here? Or did he go back to-    Interviewee:	He is working in D.C.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.    Interviewee:	And he majored in economics at Harvard. And now he is a consultant in D.C.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.    Interviewer:	So, when you're talking about, um, starting this mentoring program, is part of it to sort of cut through that messaging? So s-    Interviewee:	Part- part of it is because I think that kids are indoctrinated to stay there, because they see their friends and they see everybody from our high school go, like, to the same university-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Um, or, like, stay in Texas. And I want kids to realize that, like, look, it's- it's possible to get out-    Interviewer:	It's possible.    Interviewee:	... And, like, your ... We have a finite amount of time on this Earth. Like, let's do as much as we can. And like [crosstalk 00:31:23], I don't think ... A lot of kids don't understand, like, the amount of resources there are for- for Latinos and for kids that are-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... First-generation college students. Like, I'm basically paying nothing for this university, and I have friends that are paying less than me. And it's in a u- University. It's, like, a Research-I university. So, like ... And, like, my cousin paid nothing for Harvard.    Interviewer:	Yep.    Interviewee:	Like, and ... Like, my s-, a lot of kids ... There's kids at my school, like, they're not dumb. They just, like, don't realize that these resources exist.    Interviewer:	Slow it down.    Interviewee:	So, I want to be ... A- and my counselors are more focused with the local things, like class ranks-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	... And, like, things like that, to- to be able to tell kids this.

And so, they'll either go to that one or they'll go to TAMIU, which is Texas A&M International University.    Interviewer:	Yep.    Interviewee:	So, like, I have, like, 80 best friends that ... Or 80 friends in high school. We were a graduating class of 400.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	80 that went to- to TAMIU, I think, and, like, at least a good hundred that went to P- UTPAA.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, s- a lo-, a- a good handful went to the University oF Texas. That was the university that I was supposed to go to.    Interviewer:	A- at Austin?    Interviewer:	At Austin.    Interviewee:	At Austin.    Interviewer:	Yeah, that's a great school.    Interviewee:	Yeah. And I got accepted to their business school, and, like-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... I was supposed to go there. (laughs) Um, and, like, I have, like, a good 20 friends that went there to UT.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Some friends went to Texas A&M.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	But, like ... No, then I was the only kid in my entire graduating class to leave Texas.    Interviewer:	The only one to leave. Wow. And did an ... So, that is about 50% of your class. Do about 50% of- of kids go on to college?    Interviewee:	About 50, yeah.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Some of them go to community c- ... To, like, South Texas College. It's just a little community college.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	And, um, and so, they'll just ... Or they'll go to vocational schools. So, like-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	... Become, like, the dentist assistants and stuff like that.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Or, and a lot of my friends there are males, like, they would go to work, and would just, like, at 18, they go work at the pipelines. And I mean, it's a good job. They're making $25 an hour.    Interviewer:	Hmm.    Interviewee:	But it, like ... They just didn't go to college.    //  Interviewer:	(laughs) So, speaking of networking and life after college, do you have long-term goals? Maybe 10, 20 years out, that you already [crosstalk 00:36:30]?    Interviewee:	I'm- I'm going to law school immediately after undergraduate.    Interviewer:	Immediately.

But, um, yeah, for sure I'm going to law school. I've wanted to be a lawyer my entire life.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And, um, within the next 10 to 20 years run ... I mean, go practice law-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... And maybe within 20 years run for politics.    Interviewer:	Good. And when you say, ""run for politics,"" are you thinking back in Texas?    Interviewee:	Yeah. As a-    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... State senator or a state representative, and then become ... Hopefully go, like, bigger boats. My main goal would ... Like, my life goal is to do lobbying in D.C.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewer:	Around a particular issue?    Interviewee:	I mean, I would like to do something that I care about, but, I mean, lobbying just makes a lot of money. And it has-    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... And it is good, 'cause, like, you can't expect a congressman to know everything about every single issue, so, like-    Interviewer:	Sure.    Interviewee:	... I don't want people ... I don't want you to think, like, ""Oh, lobbying"" from a perspective of, like, ""Oh, this guy's gonna, like, lobby for big tobacco or whatever."" It's like, no.

She also mentions that the flight is  expensive to get back home and that some people don't understand the challenges of those who are struggling with finances. //      QUOTES: 0:04:04 S2: Great. Why do you think it's important for you to go to college? I feel like an admissions officer but... [laughter] You're in so don't worry about it! You can say anything!     0:04:16 S1: So for me this has been pretty much the one thing my family and I have worked for. So my parents weren't born here. My mom was born in Mexico, my dad was born in Guatemala, so they didn't go to college. They didn't even finish high school. So that's my main motive, it's for them, but it's also for me. Anyway, it's just growing up and seeing them struggle, it just kinda influences you and makes you really think about your future, and college is pretty much the way out for us. It's the way to a better future, a better career and find a way to support your family. They haven't done a bad job. They started with nothing, they came here and they were able to send, so far, two girls to college, so that's good. There's two more so hopefully they go. [chuckle] But they're pretty much the reason why college is so important to me. And it's like the way my pastor told me, it's kind of an investment, you have to put the effort because you're spending money to come here.    0:05:25 S2: Are your siblings, do you have one older sibling?     0:05:28 S1: Yeah, I have an older sister, she is turning 20 and she goes to USC in California. So we're opposite ends. [chuckle]    0:05:37 S2: So you branched out.    0:05:39 S1: Yeah. And then I have a brother who's a junior in high school, and then a baby brother who's turning three. [chuckle] Yeah, he was a surprise. [laughter]  //  0:12:43 S2: Yeah, and when you think back to how you felt coming here, when you said that you wish you had more confidence about coming here, your decision to come here. What were some of your decisions in coming here, what would have been the alternative for you? Were you struggling with the decision?     0:13:05 S1: A little, I mean since it was early decision I didn't really have a choice, but I don't think of it that way because you technically could find a way to come, like maybe something could have happened. I don't know but, I think the main set back of coming here was the distance where my parents. My dad was really worried, and then after the whole Boston Marathon situation he was really, ""Oh, no you're so far. What if an emergency happens what's going to happen to you?"" And the flight, it's also really expensive. But that was really the only thing, an alternative if I didn't come here would be probably going to school in Southern California. A lot of the schools I applied to were also south. I'd be a little closer, but not too close. [chuckle]  //  0:26:49 S2: You also brought up that there seems to be a little bit, I don't know, you didn't use the word ""tension"" but that sometimes it can be hard to discuss issues around race on this campus. Could you just say a little bit more about that?     0:27:02 S1: I haven't really experienced it, but I know a lot of older students have said that at times that it can just be hard to communicate their ideas whether they're a white person without sounding racists or offensive. And then another girl, she's Latino, was telling me... It was just she was kind of complaining in a way or saying the flaws that Tufts has when discussing people, the topic of race or... I don't know. It's just some people aren't really... I don't know how to say it, sympathetic towards their experience or where they come from, or they're just not very aware of the struggles they have to face, sometimes financially, coming here. So it's just I guess they... Like what I've said before, it's like two different worlds in a way and it's how do you find a way to communicate without sounding offensive to both sides? And then, what else? There was something else. We had to read, ""Whistling Vivaldi"" for a common reading by Claude Steele.    0:28:26 S2: What was it called?     0:28:27 S1: Whistling Vivaldi, and a lot of people didn't like the book or didn't finish reading it because they were saying how his research findings were too broad and repetitive, and pretty much he just says... And Claude Steele's just stereotypes can really have an effect on minorities, and a lot of students were like, ""Well, how does that... That doesn't make sense. Stereotypes, they shouldn't really influence you or how does being a woman... "" There was an example of women in science and math, and how during tests they do worse if they hear something from a teacher, like ""Oh, women do okay on these tests"" And this one guy was just like, ""Well, that doesn't make sense to me."" It's just like, ""Well, you're not a woman. You're not a person of color. You don't really know how these stereotypes can really affect you or how prevalent they are just around school or in a mall or something"", just in general. So it's this lack of knowledge as well that affects it.  //  "

He also mentions being poor multiple times and compares different SES students at Tufts. //    QUOTES: A:  I didn’t, Westport, Connecticut, is not a very diverse town. There are very few people of color, very few non-straight people, very few, very little variety in the class, and I was basically poor, black and gay, and tall, and distinct-looking, and a pretty homogenous face. So that was, at the time, I sort of felt special, but now I realize I was more sort of just, like, the other. Sort of like, there’s this phrase in, like, cinema called “the magical negro” – that was definitely my life in high school. So, that sucked.   //  A:  No, I became an English minor to mitigate my hatred for sociology. Yeah, sociology just tells you there is difference, but doesn’t do anything about it, and that bothers me, because –    Q:  It what? Say it again?    A:  Sociology just tells you that there’s a difference, but doesn’t do anything about it. And it’s like, yeah, I’m poor, black and gay, I fucking know there’s a difference. Like, tell me things I already know with numbers does not make me feel better about my situation, or give me any tools to change it, or help someone else who is in the same situation.   //  Part of me wants to say go abroad, but I didn’t go abroad, and I don’t feel like I’ve lost anything. But I think going abroad can be great. I think everybody should have a chance to go abroad. Even if they don’t want to, they should have a chance to. Like, there should be no reason they can’t go abroad, especially financially.  //  Q:  Okay. Thank you. How might students who graduate from Tufts be different or lead different lives than students at other schools? If you even think that’s the case.    A:  I mean, I don’t know how much our perspective has weight, because I don’t know many graduates from other schools, because most of my friends at other schools are still there. I think, hmm, the three types of Tufts graduates I’ve seen are the, like, legacy, traditional, “I’m going to work on Wall Street now after doing econ and entrepreneurial leadership” – like the typical --  But I don’t think that’s a Tufts thing. I think that certain kids graduate college and just go back to the life that they’ve been living their entire life. Fine, cool. That’s not the worst thing ever.    Then there are Tufts kids who, like, go and try their bleeding heart thing somewhere else, and, like, they’re like the global citizens who, like, move to Cairo the day after graduation to, like, fight the power. Or, like, go do TFA because they want to, like, change the world, but, like, not the way I want it to. They think that walking into a class for two years will actually change the world. I think there are certain Tufts kids who take the, like, “Tufts will save the world  mentality into the world,” and they try to do those things.    And then I think there’s this sort of, like, weird third group that kind of is, like, gets by. Like, Tufts is not Harvard. Tufts is not UNC. Tufts is like a big name school in the academic world, but, like, in the rest of the world, it’s not a thing. I mean, Tufts is, I mean, like, Tufts is not as big a thing as it could be, you know? And so, the people are kind of just, like, moving to middle class, sort of, like, average lives, that you never hear about. I think that’s a really fair thing. So I think that sometimes kids get disappointed by it, but, like, “You went to Tufts, chill out. It was a great school, Tufts is still a great school academically and everything, but, like, you didn’t go” --  That wasn’t what you had to do, it wasn’t meant for you to do all of those things. I think some people move into medium life, just medium life, like either middle class or  mediocre work or whatever – most, a solid number of Tufts kids move into average life happily, because they have no misconceptions of who they are, or [01:03:49] what they are, whatever. Some kids who think they’re God’s gift to green earth –    Some kids who think they’re God’s gift to the green earth move into average life, and are depressed. And then I think some kids like me will move from, like, start from the bottom, now we’re here, and I’m really okay --  I mean, I don’t think that I’ll be average. I think that I’m going to be a hermit who writes honestly, so seriously, so I think I have some potential to be sort of interesting in life. But, like, I didn’t see Tufts as this big game-changer where now I’ll be a millionaire, or now I’ll be the icon for race and ethnicity in America. I never saw that for myself, so, like, it’s almost like doing good work for where I could be. And so, I feel very comfortable moving into, like, some sort of average, as some sort of average for me life. I think those are the three paths of Tufts students.  //  "

Cause, and especially because you know, I'm not going to go buy a mill and a [inaudible 00:33:40] and a laser cutter and a 3-D printer, and I don't know how to use them. And I'm going to teach myself before I ... I'm not going teach myself before I ... or teach myself after I buy a three- I'm not going to buy a couple thousand dollar thing before I know how to use it.

""Uh, so I do this and other surveys often because, so I appreciate the process of self reflection and pulling out, sort of synthesizing things that I've done or bigger lessons that I've gotten. Uh, I appreciate going through that and thinking through these things and hashing through these things and sort of helping as a guiding process and really pulling more out of the experiences that I just had processed and I think surveys are nice because it's someone else to hash through or talk through or a particular framework for doing it. It's always different and you never know ... uh, but I also, it's one that like I can do this thing that I really enjoying doing and find a lot of use out of and it pays me some, so."""

Well, my first goal is just be involved in the academics, learn as much as I can. And I guess related to that is prepare me for what I plan to do beyond college. So, right now, I'm applying to medical school, so that was my priority is getting my pre-reqs, getting as much preparation for MCAT standardized testing, all of that. That was my priority. But secondly, I wanted to live the college experience, get involved, extracurriculars, meet people, make a lot of friends, that kind of thing. And just have a really rich, I guess, college experience. And third, I just... Sort of relating back to what I said earlier, I wanted to have this, learn how to live independently because after college, I don't really plan to move back in with my parents. I wanted to learn how to manage my time, also manage my money, be smart, stuff like that.  //  46:27 S2: Sure. So, to gain different perspectives, I think that is just a life skill. I don't think it's anything that can be restricted to a certain field. And because it's so general and applies in so many situations, that's really important. Education, not only are we learning about whatever major you choose, but you're just learning to have a different attitude and perspective. And just be aware that things are always changing, you should be open to these changes, stuff like that.    46:56 S2: Learning to live independently. I think that's really important. When I come out of college... And I've heard this from so many people, that people are just, they just don't know how to function. Personal finance is a huge issue, and people just don't know what to do with their money. People are living like slobs. Just learning how to manage your life, and keep your life functional, and have a clean environment, and everything like that, I think it's super important because, yeah, you can be making so much money and having this great job, and everything, but if everything else in your life is...    47:31 S1: Chaotic.    47:31 S2: Chaotic, yeah, you're not going to be having a good time.   //"
1210,P040,School 8,Low Importance,Seniors,"LOW IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: He talks about the importance of going to college for financial reasons, but this is mostly general and not specific to his own experience. //    QUOTES: 19:36 S1: So... Let's see... I wanna ask an interesting question. Do you think it's important for people to go to college?     19:51 S2: It depends on the person, I definitely think. Because I think, the value of a college education is different for different people. And I think there are a lot of people who don't... Well, what was the question?     20:13 S1: Is it important to go to college?     20:14 S2: Is it important? Let me think.    20:20 S1: Not an easy question.    20:24 S2: I think, from an economic perspective, like you look at it, it's really difficult to... I mean, the difference between lifetime income from people with just a high school diploma... And obviously that's been well documented, that's a pretty wide margin. So, there's a sense that college isn't necessary, but then when I think when you look at the type of college. I think, especially for middle to upper class affluent areas, there's a huge kind of... Either pressure or just a sense that it's necessary to go to a certain type of college that's like a prestigious, a very high tuition kind of, well-known school. And I don't that's always necessary.    21:19 S2: I think that, and I obviously don't know this for sure, but I think that at a lot of state schools in the country and a lot of, like small community colleges, different things, you can get a really solid education for a much lower price. So, if we're looking at it from that perspective, I think, college is important because it just seems like, people who have less than a college degree or a Bachelor's like really drop off, and have a harder time. But the type of college, I think, doesn't, there's not one type that's good for all, and like that's great about America. There's so many different higher institutions options, but I would say it is.    22:01 S2: And, it also I think, the onus falls on the individual to make the most of this college experience, because I think someone could go to Harvard for four years and do just enough to get by, but make very little of his time there, and they're paying a lot to be there. Whereas, someone could go somewhere much lesser known, and really try to explore everything that that place has to offer, and gain a lot more from their experience. So it's what you make of it, obviously a cliche to say, but the underlaying question, I would say college is important, because I think the strides you make are huge from that I've made from freshman year of college to senior year of college, much bigger than freshman year of high school to senior of high school both academically, I think I'm a much stronger writer personally, and then you grow, I think, as a person more in the college years, than in high school years. So I think there's a lot of growing. Could that take place without being on a college campus? Maybe. It could probably, but I definitely think college helps for that development. So, in a lot of ways more than just the financial help I think. It is important. Some form of higher education after high school is important.  //  24:59 S1: So, let's talk about why one is number one.    25:04 S2: So, the statement alone, I think, puts a lot of people off, in the sense it sounds very kind of fickle and single-mind... To get a job and I don't think it's as simple as that statement makes it out to be, but at the end of the day, you are making this huge investment for a payoff in the future. It's not, it shouldn't be for nothing. So, there's a hope that out of college you can get paid more than you would've, if you didn't put in all that money. And then, 10 years from now, you'll have evened out or maybe even, sooner than that, you'll have gained back what you spent for this education and then, you'll be better off for financial security going forward.    25:55 S2: And I think, the other thing sounds much better, and I think they're super important as well, but the job aspect is that, that's what the degree is for. That is what it symbolizes, ""I have a college degree. This should help me in the job market. And I wanna get a job."" But, I definitely could see why people would not agree that that's the priority. And I feel even like kind of... I don't know, to me, yeah... I'm not a very materialistic person, and I don't think money is the end all, be all. But, when you're just looking at what is the point of going to college and spending all the money and that's the question. Why it's important to go... I mean, to me that seems like that's the reason. Right. I think it's interesting. I think, if you gave students this sheet, very few would have to get a job as one and there'd be different thing. I mean, this sounds the best, getting different perspectives on... And that's super important. I think if you gave it to parents of the students...    27:10 S1: Yes. Which we will.    27:11 S2: Right. To get a job would be number one much more often, and that's the sense like... At this point... And I bet freshmen are gonna put these things more than to get a job. But now I'm on the way out, I can sympathize more with my parents having to contribute or pay for it. So, it's kind of like, ""You know what? This is what it comes down to. It is like a job thing."" But, then to gain the different perspectives is completely true, and that, I think, goes back to the growth as a person that I think, you have being on a college campus, which in most cases is a lot more diverse than whatever your high school environment was like. So that's huge to just change your perspective, and become more... A better thinker, more articulate and more open-minded in a lot of ways. The other two. ""To learn to live independently."" I feel like, you'll do that at some point in your life and people vary on their levels of independence, but to me, that definitely doesn't seem as crucial as the first two.    28:28 S2: And then, ""To study particular content area in depth."" The only reason I say this is, especially going to a liberal arts school, I feel like you leave a liberal arts education with as... Either a much better thinker, a much better writer, a much better... A lot of different things. I think you're much better prepared to go out into the world and find out what you wanna do. But, in terms of tangible skills in one specific area, I think the majority of kids don't actually have this particular content area in depth where they are... And that's what either graduate school is for, or that's what just working in the real world is for. Whereas, if you go to an engineering school or a school specific to your work, then number four is, well, that's what. You're studying a particular content area in depth. But at liberal arts, even your major, I feel like a lot of kids don't leave with too many kind of tangible skills that they can kind of say, ""Well, I really honed in on this area."" You're kind of just getting a very broad education. So, that's why that would be four for me.    29:43 S1: Great. So, when you were talking about number one, you said for a minute, ""I feel like I even feel kind of like... "" What were you going to say at the end of that sentence?     29:52 S2: I don't know. It just sounds kind of... What is the word I'm looking for? To get a job. It sounds like very money-driven, and very one-dimensional in the sense... Like that's all you care about in this world, is to be financially successful kind of thing. But it's not the case I think though. But from the sense of what is this college for, what are we paying the tuition for, what is the degree for, the degree symbolizes... Gives you that advantage in the job market that gaining different perspectives of people now, it's great, but that's not what does it. It's...  //  44:50 S1: Okay. What about administrators? What do you think they think the goal of the college experience is for students?     44:57 S2: Administrators... You know, administrators might go... I feel like faculty in a lot of ways have the students' best interests in mind, because they're teachers, and teachers have for the most part, the best hearts of people. A lot of people you'll come across because... Right, they're just, they're educators and they just want you to grow as a learner and a thinker. Administrators, I feel, might go back towards the job side of things, because they're looking at it from... They want the best for their students, but they also want... They're running a business and they wanna make sure that certain quotas are met, in terms of... They remain selective and there's a certain number they let in, a certain percentage, aA certain percentage that graduate, a certain percentage that transfer, a certain bar for the average income of first years out, a certain bar for 10 years out, like what the... And they kind of want to meet those numbers I feel. It's a much more calculated... I guess I have a negative view of administrative... But I feel it's much more on the end of, they feel the most important thing is, get a job and be financially successful afterwards 'cause that bodes well for them, and it looks good for them and... Which is not a bad thing.  //"

So, one thing they passed this year which was nice, but until then, it was sort of like I want to live with my good friend but they don't have as much money as I do, we can't live in this place because of that.

Um, so I believe that more programs and certain helps like the ASAP [inaudible 00:51:49].    This is really important, because some students might be holding down their readings, although you might be able to rent a book or go to the library and get some copies. It isn't a lot of the same as having that textbook there with you. You know, being able to read it. So I believe that's one of the things.

Now that I'm here with John Jay I see- Like I have like nine textbooks per class. That's a lot. I cannot complain anymore. I just have to go with it.

LAS1505,P064,School 9,Low Importance,Freshmen,"LOW IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: She mentions students making good use of time because they're paying for it, not having to worry about paying bills yet but transitioning to more independence, that her brother worries about paying his bills, and that a job is an important result of college because of the high cost. I was between low and medium here. //    QUOTES: 0:32:54 S1: Okay. Do you ever feel that there's such a thing as too much student to student interactive work?     0:33:08 S2: I don't know. I guess, I think that's something that I might have come across in high school, where sometimes... If you're given a week to work on a project with a partner in class, and you have every day to do it, then I think that a certain amount of it would turn into just goofing around or talking. But I think that that's just something that kind of goes along with being 15 or 16 years old, and being stuck inside a school all day with your friends. I don't think I've ever come across something like that while here. I think it's a combination of the fact that class time is so much more important because there's less of it, and also because most of us are paying for it in one way or another. So I think that everyone has more of an appreciation for the amount of time that we have, so people are less likely to waste it.  //  0:41:27 S1: Great. So, thinking with that in mind and also a little more broadly, what are the benefits of living on a college campus? I mean you just said that, are there any other benefits?     0:41:42 S2: I would definitely think it is nice that you're in this kind of community of education, so I think helps me focus on my school work a little more. I also think that it's a really good experience just to get used to being away from home, because I know some people who've graduated high school and just moved out of their houses and they are immediately living in an apartment somewhere, buying their own groceries, paying for their own electricity and I feel like that's a lot to handle all at once and I know that some people are very capable of doing that, but I really appreciate the opportunity to kind of transition into it. I am living by myself and there are certain things that I do buy for myself. Now, if I run out of shampoo, I have to go to Rite Aid and buy it rather than just tell my mom. But at the same time, I don't have to worry, did I pay the electricity bill on time? I am completely out of food, I need to go to the grocery store. So, I think it's that transition is just really, really valuable in allowing young people to get used to the idea of living on their own without being thrown into it without any kind of assistance.    0:42:58 S1: Yeah.    0:42:59 S2: And also I think it's a really good experience to kind of... You have some times to, kind of, figure yourself out as an adult without that pressure because I feel like, if you move out, and you move right into this apartment, and you're working, and you're buying your own groceries, and feel like your entire life could become just going to work and then going home to your little apartment and making yourself spaghetti, and watching Netflix or something. Whereas here, I don't have to worry about certain things and I'm surrounded by people who are my own age and have similar interests. So, it really gives me an opportunity to talk with people and experience things, and kind of figure myself out as an adult without all of the pressure of paying my bills and going to work every morning and that kind of thing. So, I think that, that's really a valuable experience.  //  0:48:41 S2: I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure about the other ones. I don't think. I guess as far as mental health issues go, I haven't run into a whole lot of people who are overtly, who would just outwardly fess up to having a very serious mental health issues, but I do know a lot of people who are very stressed out. But I know my brother has a really heavy workload, and I know that he gets really stressed out about just having time to get all of his homework done and work and pay his bills. So that one just... Even just because of stress, it probably would be number two.  //  0:58:13 S1: Great. If you could advise an incoming freshman, what would be three pieces of advice that you think would help him or her make the most of the college experience?     0:58:31 S2: Three pieces of advice. I guess I would definitely tell them to try to live on campus. I know some people who live decently close and they commute, and I know that it saves a lot of money, but I think that just being here is part of the experience and that it's harder to invest yourself and to really throw yourself into it if you're not here.   //  1:07:18 S2: Why it's important to go to college, explain. Let's see. I guess I feel like the most important thing to me is gaining different perspectives on people, knowledge in the world. Just because I think that no matter what, even if you don't get a job in the field that you came here and studied for or even if you don't finish it, no matter what it's gonna change you somehow as a person. It's gonna make you more informed and give you a perspective that you might not have come across otherwise. Yeah, I think that that's important just as a human being, so that's probably the first. I guess I'd say to get a job secondly because ultimately, as awesome as it is to gain perspectives on people, I don't think that I could sell my parents on $25,000 a year because I wanna gain perspectives on the world. There's gotta be some kind of... If you're investing so much monetarily into something, there has to be some kind of a gain or a reward that you get for it eventually. So getting a job is definitely the second one.    1:08:47 S2: Learning to live independently I think is third because like I said, I know people who moved straight out of their houses after high school and moved into an apartment and I think that they... They can take care of themselves and plenty of them get along fine, but I think that it's just an amount of stress that you don't necessarily have to go to and I think it's really good to be able to get that transitionary period without so much stress and without being the only person responsible for yourself. And then, I put studying in a particular content area in depth last because it is important but especially for more specified job fields, but ultimately, like I said, some people end up working in fields that are entirely separate from their degree. And I think with some things... Some majors aren't necessarily a very in depth look at a very narrow topic.    1:09:59 S2: Some things are a kind of wide look at a general topic. So I think that it's less getting, becoming an expert on one thing but becoming open and receptive to many things and you learn how to use your resources so that even if you don't learn exactly everything about one particular topic, if you need to know something that you didn't learn in college you've been given the resources and you can go out in the world and you can figure it out for yourself if you need to. If you need to learn something, look something up or teach yourself how to do something I think that college gives you the resources to do that.  //  "

So, what would you say to people that argue that they could get a sufficient education just online? Do you think that's valid? Do you think there are problems with that?     15:54 S1: I think it's definitely valid, if it works for you; but you're definitely missing out on the interactions you have with your classmates and also professors. So, it's a give and take. Online, it's probably more convenient and cheaper, but if it works for you, then it works. // 30:27 S1: Okay. I would definitely advise them to like, really think about how much they value college. Like, whether they would consider going to state school or like a private school. And whether, what they wanna get out of it. 'Cause there are times... I mean, it's kind of early right now to think this, but when I was homesick, I'm like, ""I'm paying to go far away from home, when I could be getting that for a lot cheaper near my home."" And like, ""I wanna come to see my family.""    30:55 S2: Right.    30:56 S1: But, I'd be, that might change in a couple of years, where I really am more settled in, and not homesick that often. But right now, it's something to think about. And, I've a little sister at home that, sometimes I wonder, if I should've stayed closer to home, to see her more often and like...

So what do you think needs to be in place here at UNH in order for you to accomplish those goals?     16:32 S2: Me personally or...    16:34 S1: Yeah.    16:37 S2: I would say, a good support system like academically because I feel like a lot of people come in freshman year, and they don't understand how credits work and how you need to fill these requirements, how a lot of things seem double counted and you need to make sure you're not wasting either your money or your parents' money. So it's hard to know what to do academically.  //  24:53 S1: So I know you switched majors and you've had sort of an interesting four years here with that, but just thinking about UNH, how do you... How has it worked for you in terms of majors and having certain requirements and electives? Have you been able to take here what you've wanted and also to be able to explore?     25:16 S2: I think it would be easier if I didn't transfer so late into Spanish, but I think that they set it up nicely for you, and so you know you're on track, or you need to take this course, or that kind of thing. But I guess if you're gonna change majors, you screw up the system, and you need to figure out on your own to make sure you're not behind. Because I feel that in the university system, to them, it's like, ""Oh just stay an extra semester,"" and that's fine for them. But, if I can get out a semester before or on time, then that's much more financially and logistically, it makes more sense.  //  50:54 S1: Okay. If you could advise an incoming freshman, what would three pieces of advice be to help him or her make the most of the college experience?     [pause]    51:18 S2: Maybe don't choose the field that you wanna go into the beginning of freshman year. And... I would say, don't party every weekend.    51:46 S1: Because?     51:48 S2: Because you're wasting your time and money, and your safety, in a lot of cases. And then I would say, keep in touch with your friends from home, like from high school but don't be clung on to them... Clinging on to them. And try to make new friends, too.    52:18 S1: And in terms of not choosing the field the beginning of freshman year, why do you say that?     52:24 S2: Well, for me, I was like, ""This is what I'm gonna do,"" and I feel like I jumped right into the courses. But I think that, if I didn't have a major set, if I didn't know I wanted to choose Social Work, then I would kind of think more about what do I actually want to do in the end when I'm out, rather than ""This is what I'm gonna do.""  //"

Um, so when you were deciding on where you wanted to go to college why did you end up choosing OSU over other schools that you might have been looking at?]    So, I chose Ohio State because it was in a big city and I really wanted to get a big city experience before I went out into the real world.    And I also just wanted (sighs) a different perspective because I came from a very, like I said homogenous town, and, people really looked the same, they thought the same, and I wanted a, I really wanted to experience like different things and meet different people.    That was like one of my end goals, but also because it was in state and I could afford it.// [Okay. Okay. So what do you think needed to happen or be in place in order for you to realize some of those goals?]    Uh, I think I had to fail a lot.    Um, so, academical, eh, a, academically for instance, like there have been sometimes where like I was afraid I wasn't going to pass a course.    But I had to, like, really kind of like talk to myself and like figure out how am I going to like get this done ...    Um, in order to achieve my goals. Um, I mean, I also work 30 hours a week right now.    [Wow.]    In addition to being a full-time student.

And then I also work in a sorority house-// Um, I think it definitely made my GPA where it's at, it could've been a lot lower. Um, I'd say, there's a lot of support on campus, like through my school like we have a lot of programming, a lot of money being put around like safety or like, there's a lot of things I don't have to worry about.

Okay, so I just have two final questions for you. Um, so what motivated you or interested you to participate in our interview today?]    Um, honestly I really like talking about college.    [(Chuckle).]    Um, almost all my jobs have been about, I don't know, representing OSU in some way, and I'm obviously going into higher ed, so-    [Yeah-]    I just like it and I think it's a very important thing. Um, the money didn't hurt (sighs), um, but like I think that's not honestly like probably the first reason.    [Yeah.]    I like talking about it, yeah.// Like working on your own, figuring out what you really believe, testing yourself like in hard situations like am I going to like pass this class?

I took French all throughout high school, I loved it, I came here, and the professors are really nice people. It's not the professors at all. They're super nice, very well educated. They're actually native speakers so they know what they're talking about, but it's a hybrid course where 50% of the class is online, 50% of the class is in class. Personally, as someone who can't really afford a super nice computer that can run these programs, it kind of hinders me from doing the best that I can do. I would honestly get rid of any hybrid classes at DePaul. I think they're really, really problematic if you're someone who just can't have a nice computer."" ""Yes. For one, never load your schedule with all classes you don't want. Always have at least one class that you're interested in.

A lot of people go to Queens from transfer students, and people that come from different states that I've never been to, talking about their experiences and their ideas, and I think that's important to get immersed into. And you're all equals, so it's just, you're all on an equal playing field, you're all trying to get from one part of your life to another.

For a lot of people, especially for someone like me who doesn't really know what they want to do and I feel like this is an important time for exploration and discovery, because there are so many opportunities here that eventually, I will narrow it down to what I want to do with my life or at least what I wanna do first. But there are a lot of people who go to vocational schools who really have an idea of what they already like to do and then so I'm not sure how useful college is for those people, like if they can go right in to a career, that makes more sense, money-wise, especially.  //  06:23 S2: So if you were the dean of your school and you could start from scratch to design your own program for students to take while they're here for four years, what would that program be like? What kinds of knowledge and information would be most important for students to take away?     06:39 S1: Well, I actually have... The dean that we have right now, Dean Kirkpatrick, he's awesome. He'll talk your ear off about this.    [chuckle]    06:52 S1: But I think he highly values traveling abroad. And I would definitely value the same thing because I think there's nothing better than the perspective that you gain from living in a country that's not your own for a while. It just gives you a clearer perspective on life and other people, and I think that's invaluable to everyone, really. And if you have the economic opportunity, then you should definitely travel abroad. But also, just keeping an open mind. I like how in the College of Liberal Arts we have these core requirements that allow you to discover more about what you're good at and what you like learning about, and I think that's really important.    07:34 S1: And then also, I'd probably have courses available on how to do things in real life, like taxes and changing your car tire because I've never been to a school that actually has those, and as great as my parents are at teaching me that stuff, I feel like there's always more stuff that I can know and they don't always have time to teach me how to change a tire. So I think those are actually pretty important. 'Cause a lot of people go off and they just don't really know how to do these things.  //  39:20 S1: Okay, well, I want to say, ""to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge, and the world"" is most important, but unfortunately, first and foremost, I think comes getting a job just because financial stability is really, really important to pretty much everything else. And we don't want it to be like that. We don't want money to be the thing ruling our lives, but to be able to do things that are interesting and special, you need money to do that. Probably, job, number one.    39:55 S2: Okay.    39:56 S1: Two, would be ""to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge and the world"". Third most important...    40:00 S2: And tell me... Go ahead.    40:04 S1: Okay. Third most important is ""to learn to live independently"". And then fourth is ""to study a particular content area in depth"".    40:12 S2: Great. So you talked me through number one, and why ""to get a job"" would be first. Tell me why ""to gain a different perspective"" is number two, or even would be your number one, if it could be.    40:24 S1: I think because a lot of growing happens in the college years, and I think the mental growth is first and foremost, but not just in terms of what you learn, it's how you see the world. Learning to form your own opinions on what the world is, is very important, to learn your place in it and how you want to fit in it. You're learning like where you stand and who you are as a person, and I think that's really important to the rest of your life.    40:57 S2: Wonderful. Okay, so tell me about number three. Why is that one so important?     41:04 S1: I mean, that one's just like, that, to me, is more concrete; how to cook your own food, how to shower for, at the correct times of the day. That's just, that's just simple life skills. You've been living, hopefully, I guess with nice parents for many years, and they tell you when and how to do most things even without meaning to just because they love you and they care about you, and they want you to be healthy and clean and happy.    41:29 S1: And once you move away, it's not like you have to learn how to do those things because you already know, but figuring out your own schedule is actually really important and something that I actually struggled with the first couple weeks. I was up 'til like 3:00 every morning, and I ate like twice a day and once at night, and it was just weird.    [chuckle]    41:50 S2: So you had to figure out how to get yourself on sort of a more regular schedule, or you had to figure out how to adapt to living that way?     41:54 S1: Yeah. Yeah, and I was happy at the same time all this weird sleep-eating was going on because I was like, ""I'm doing it myself, at least. It's on me."" But eventually, you learn how to fit in the schedule that you want.    42:10 S2: Got it.

But I do think that college provides a lot of other basic information that is really crucial to an independent life in this world, and so, just because these are things that you learn that aren't courses, and they're kind of innate to being a human, I think it'd come first.  //"

The only personal finance reference is related to her parents still somewhat supporting her. //      QUOTES: Interviewer:	Okay. Great. Do you think that, um, it's important for people to go to college?    Interviewee:	Um, I think that if people want to pursue a job where they need a college degree, then, yes. And, I think that, um, I think that it's definitely a great experience in terms of having people, um, think more critically about their lives and about the world.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative)    Interviewee:	So, yeah, I would say that I would encourage people to go to college if they are within the means to do so, which, is always the difficulty.    //  Interviewer:	Um, when you think about what you get from sitting there in person versus being on-line, do you think that there are classes you've taken that you could have gotten just as much out of, um, without, sort of, sitting in the lecture hall?    Interviewee:	Yes, definitely.    Interviewer:	Are there some that come to mind for that?    Interviewee:	Um, well, I know that the, I took Nutrition 101, and I know that, that is also offered on-line.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Um, in the summer actually, and I, like, wish now that I had taken it on-line because it was definitely, um, I could have just read the textbook and been totally fine. So, yeah, that's definitely one. Cause again, like, the listening to a lecture, um, is difficult for, it's just not my learning style, so, reading a textbook is actually, I think I do a lot better.    Interviewer:	And, um, so the class being offered on-line, how does that work in terms of enrollment, and credits, and paying for it and all that good stuff, do you know?    Interviewee:	Um, I know that, you, it's just like a regular, you get a regular one credit. Tufts is just a one for one credit system. Um, so, you just get a regular credit. Um, it would be just the same as if it showed up, if, if you took it during the semester. I know that you do have to pay extra. I don't know how much it is? But, all summer classes, you have to pay for. Um, and, in terms of, like, the course cred, like, the, the work, I'm not totally sure how they do that. I mean, I remember in the class we had, like, tests, just like multiple choice tests and then we had, like, a final project so, I don't think it would be difficult to set up some sort of system of doing that on-line.    //  Interviewer:	Um, so what are the benefits of living on a college campus?    Interviewee:	Well, um, being really close to, you know, all of the stuff that's going on, on campus is very convenient. Um, Tufts requires the, I don't know how much you know about, like, the Tufts academic, I don't want to bore you with that.    Interviewer:	Um, well, the, all I know about the living requirements is I think you're required for the first two years, is that right?    Interviewee:	Yeah, yeah, that's right. So, um, that I actually really liked about Tufts that you can move off as a Sophomore. Um, so, I guess, the benefits of living on campus is, yeah, is like, being close. There are so many events that are going on and so much, um, discussion that's going on, on campus, so, that's, really cool that you're, like, right by all of that. And then, I guess living with a bunch of really, very bright, very passionate students is also great. It's like a very, Tufts is, like, one of those places that it's very normal to, like, go to a party and talk about, like, world issues.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative)    Interviewee:	Um, so, that was, that's definitely very fun. And, as a Freshman, I just thought that was the coolest thing.    Interviewer:	(Laughs) And, so do you live off campus now?    Interviewee:	I do, yes.    Interviewer:	And, what are the differences of being a student who lives off campus versus one who is living right there?    Interviewee:	Um, well, it's definitely, I think, a byproduct of just getting a little bit older and not being into the Freshman and Sophomore scene that is, you know, is college and going to frat parties and, you know, doing that sort of thing. And, not, most of the Seniors that I know do not, don't really go to on campus parties anymore.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative)    Interviewee:	Um, so, it's just, I feel like a little bit more of an adult now. I mean, obviously, I'm not a real adult, but, um, you know, I, like, pay my own rent and I have to walk a few blocks to campus and I live by my laundry mat, and stuff like that, so, it's just like a little more moving into the real world.    Interviewer:	Yep. So, when you say that you're not a real adult yet, what is a real adult? What does that look like?    Interviewee:	Oh, I just, it's just like, my family has this funny thing where we talk, where we get, like a level. And, you're, like a Junior fake adult or you're a slightly real adult and they, like, make fun of each other. Um, and, so, the rule is, you're a real adult when you're living on your own and you're paying all your own bills and you're not relying on your parents financially. That's the cut off that they have decreed.    Interviewer:	And, do you have siblings? Is that where this comes from?    Interviewee:	Yeah, I have a brother and I have a bunch of cousins.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay, great. So, pay your own rent, live near the laundry mat and walk a few blocks to campus. Where does that fall on the family spectrum of adulthood?    Interviewee:	Um, I'm, like, getting up there. I think they say, like, ... I, I don't remember what the levels are. My brothers like a junior fake, or when we were in high school, we were, like, junior fake adults and now we're, like, fake adults. I don't know, I forget how it works.    Interviewer:	(laughs) That's funny.    Interviewee:	But, it's definitely moving up the spectrum. Also, turning 21 moves you up the spectrum.    //"

It was all really small schools.  I looked at Endicott, and I thought I was going to Endicott in Beverly. // I guess I mean — like I applied for a SURF grant, and I think opportunities like that, and you know, UNH isn’t a school that has a co-op program where you’re required to do an internship or anything like that, so you really have to be aware of those things, and reach out to them because it’s not a requirement for you. // Interviewee:	I don’t know.  Just like keep working.  I think it’s — it comes with experience and time, and you know, I really wanted to graduate in four years, and just this year I’ve been, “Well, maybe I won’t do the BFA.  Maybe I’ll just graduate and have a BA and just move on.” But I decided — you know, I’m going to stay a whole fifth year, and a whole extra year of tuition, like why am I doing that?  But it’s just I think experiencing it, and you grow so much, so it’s something that I can’t worry about, and it just has to happen, and I think I’m on the right track to that happening. // Interviewee:	Well actually, that’s funny because my stepsister got most every — she did all of her classes — she got her master’s online, and my stepmom got her master’s online, and they’re actually — my stepmom is very against UNH.

You could do it so much cheaper, and I think like she doesn’t understand — I find so much value in a classroom experience and like having other students and I think it feels motivating, and I wouldn’t — like with an online submission and things like that, I wouldn’t feel like I was held as accountable for things. // Interviewee:	Ok.  My number one is studying abroad.  If it’s financially possible and you can do it, I went this summer — I went to Italy — and you can’t put it into words or explain it, because it’s like the experience of being abroad — you’re experiencing a different culture and a totally different way of life, and just little things it challenges.  Like just a daily schedule.  Like the idea of having siesta in the middle of the day.  You see the way that different people live, and it puts you — takes you aback a little bit, and puts your life into perspective.  That’s only one.  [Laughs] And then I would say probably like I did a — I was part of a SURF grant, so applying for grants at UNH —     Interviewer:	What is a SURF grant?    Interviewee:	It’s a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship.  And it is like incredible and they fund you for a summer to do research and I actually did research in psychology which isn’t even my major anymore, but it was such an amazing experience to do my own research and have a project of my own I had to be self-motivated in, an you know, not everybody gets that sort of thing, but there are a lot of opportunities that are similar to it, and even just the experience of writing a grant proposal I think was really valuable. // Interviewee:	I work a lot.  I work 12 hours a week at the fellowship in the museum, and then I work anywhere from 4 to 6 hours a week at the dean’s office.    Interviewer:	And what do you do at the fellowship museum?    Interviewee:	I help with installations, and the exhibits and construction of the exhibits and handling the art, and then I’m also working on the PR stuff and social media with them — posters and stuff. // Interviewee:	Well, actually, you didn’t ask — or I probably just didn’t tell you.  I could have told you when I talked to you about where I came from.  But I’m a first generation college student as well, so — I hope we’re not talking too much.      Interviewer:	What?    Interviewee:	I hope I’m not talking too much.    Interviewer:	No, no, no.  I’m happy to listen.      Interviewee:	Well, so it was kind of a big deal for me to come to school, or maybe it wasn’t a big enough deal.  I never felt pushed to come to college, so looking back on it, why did I have such a strong desire to end up here?  And my background is much different than a lot of other people and students.  Most of their parents have at least bachelor’s degrees — most of my friends.  And like both — my dad’s been unemployed for like eight years, and my mom has owned a beauty salon, like makes under $30,000 a year, so I don’t know.

And then, more importantly, it's a dedicated place, because you are 100% here for learning, whether you're learning rote skills, history, or whether you're learning how to be, um, a better sports player or whatever. College is necessary. I'm not sure whether, um, I'm not sure which college version is best, like, you know, whether a research institution, or a, just a regular college, but, I'm pretty certain that it's completely necessary.      Of course, I'm paying $60,000 a year to go here, so, goddamn better believe it. //   Let's see what else. Um, I mean, just like, more availabilities for scholarships, I suppose, but I'm also, like, more availabilities for, um, just innovation. So like students putting forward ideas that they want to do, something, like, robotics club, or study on, uh, the economics of the surrounding areas, or farm life. Or the culture life of, whatever. So. // Speaker 1:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). And, um, uh, so, on the other side, from your perspective, what are the biggest concerns on Kenyon's campus?    Speaker 2:  Uh, lack of diversity. Um, because most of the stuff I've been talking about socially just doesn't apply if you don't have a diversity of perspective, background, race, gender. Um, and then, of course, cost of education, which is honestly just, um, it propagates more lack of diversity because if the cost is so high, then you can't have certain people, and you tend to go toward certain people. // Uh, so get a job I put at 2, because lot of people, it's pretentious to say people should come to college to get a job, because right now it's too expensive to not have that as foremost in your head, but, um, number one is, to me, to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge in the world because, um, that will help you with everything. It will help you learn to live independently, and it'll obviously, if you gain different perspectives, you're gonna have, study a particular content in depth, and you're going to get a good, better job.

Once I'd decided on my major I thought through like, ""Well, what kind of job could I get with my econ and Spanish double major and how can I apply these skills that I have learned in the classroom? What would make me happiest going right from Kenyon into the workplace?"" So that was in the back of my head for the first two years and then I kind of started to slowly hone in on what I knew I would end up wanting to do. So I think that that was one of the main goals of college, was to find your passion, be able to develop some skills that will allow you to reach that end goal. But I guess there is... I mean, that is just the broad idea of college, was what I thought.   //  I guess with a liberal arts education you're always a little bit worried about how well your skills are going to translate to the real world. And I kind of knew that coming in, so I think that's why I chose... But it was part of my decision choosing economics. I knew that Economics was something that you can really sell. And not only did I really enjoy the major, but I knew I could sell myself having that degree versus some of my friends who were maybe in a less marketable major, kind of beginning freshman year felt that tension and knew that they would have to do very, very well in school in order to [22:02] ____ to continue [22:08] ____.    22:11 S1: Oh, you cut off right at the end. So, you said the friends in the less marketable majors felt more tension, and then I missed something.    22:20 S2: And just I guess they felt a little bit more pressure to succeed academically knowing that it might be more challenging to do whatever they wanted to do after graduation.    22:35 S1: And what types of majors were the less marketable ones, were the ones where people really had to kind of work harder?     22:42 S2: Specifically at Kenyon, it probably would be maybe sociology, classics.

So, I know this was a few years ago, but when you were applying, what made you choose Duke?     0:03:14 S2: Yeah. So, the biggest reason is actually cause my brother went to Duke. He is four years older than me, so my senior year in high school was his senior year in college. So, he had experienced four years of Duke and he's a pretty picky guy I'd say, not everything fits him very well. So, the fact that he gave Duke such a good recommendation, he was pre-med here and it's a great school for sciences and research and things like that. And he said that it was a very diverse kind of campus, and I kind of agree with that. There's really something for everybody, regardless of where you come from, what's your background, I believe. And so, I just kind of took with that and ran with it. Early decision. And so, it was really probably the only school I applied to. I applied to Emory as well, 'cause they had a scholarship thing that you get to apply early, but before I even heard back from that, I had already gotten early decision Duke. But I'm totally happy with my choice.  //  The things my brother said, he's like, ""Okay. You can go to a state school and it's a lot cheaper and save money and all that. Or you can go to Duke but... "" He actually got a free ride to Vanderbilt or something like that, or to some other school, I don't know. But then he said, ""Xing, don't go to state school. You should go to Duke"" It's really just the people. It's all about the people. It's not even about the school facilities or anything, but every single person is kind of like you really see a window to something new. They have totally different experiences. They're in different clubs, they inspire you, they motivate you. And that's definitely something I've experienced here.   //  0:32:02 S1: Great. And what do you think about the idea that education can be done completely online?     0:32:11 S2: I think it's definitely doable. I mean, the rise of... I know Coursera class is another, I don't know, website set to have online education. And it's a really useful tool because if it costs money at all, it's cheaper and a lot of times it's free which means it can be extended to those that may not have the opportunity to go to college or something but obviously they have to have computer and internet and have some ability to be able to learn very complex things.    0:32:46 S2: Then there are the downsides of not having a person explain to you cause sometimes I'll read something but I just don't understand it. Like say I'm reading a textbook and I'm like, ""Why do they do this?"" A textbook can't answer me, like why, what's going on? So I need to go find like a tutor or ask the actual teacher. So those were downsides but as opposed to like textbooks versus online, online can be a lot more interactive, like it can quiz you every once in a while and then you can see if you're right or wrong, it can correct you maybe, and there's just a lot... It's more attractive because you can have videos which honestly, you gotta take people's desire to play games and be on the internet to your advantage. People love to use their smartphones and do this and that. So you can put those elements in there, you can have gifs, you can have videos, you can have voice, all those things are advantages over a normal textbook. But I mean again, I think it's a great tool especially for just people who don't really have the access to an actual teacher or something.  //  1:04:02 S2: Yeah. I mean, I gotta go with that one. So gaining different perspectives.    1:04:11 S1: Okay, that's number one?     1:04:13 S2: It's really like a fundamental thing. You can't really lose it, you know? You can lose a job. You can lose other things, but hopefully that's something you can really kind of have it stick with you forever. And then I would say to get a job. I mean, yeah it's practical, but a lot of times, hey, you pay a lot for education, but you better get something out of it. It's definitely important.  //  1:08:00 S1: Okay, that makes sense. And how do you think parents might rank those things differently? Do you think they would rate them differently than you did?     1:08:11 S2: They might put job first.    1:08:13 S1: And why is that?     1:08:16 S2: Cause they're paying for it, I guess.  //  1:11:46 S1: Okay.

The major stuff is really useful, 'cause if you're going for a career, you have to show that you've got, you have a lot of knowledge in the specific subject. So I think if you are taking college, if you're not just taking college for fun, which would be a little waste of money, in my personal opinion... Majors are important, 'cause the universities have a tabulation, like a criteria to show that you have sufficient knowledge in an area so that employers know that you have sufficient knowledge in that area to maintain this job, to do this job, even though not always you go for the same job as you have your major, but... //   Second, starting now, learning how to manage our food points, how to...

She also briefly mentions club funding, the privileged nature of studying abroad, universities being sustained by donations, and finances as a reason for students potentially not going to college. //    QUOTES: INTERVIEWER:    Is there anything that we haven't touched upon that you think is an important thing we should be looking at in the study?    PARTICIPANT:    You didn't explicitly address race and diversity issues as much.  I know that's a really, really important aspect of it, especially because people come from different - luckily at a school like Tufts where they are able to supply, theoretically, full need-based aid, you have students that come from a lot of different backgrounds.  So there is a lot of inequality here.    You have the really privileged students that are from really rich families, and they can go off and intern or they can go off and just travel, take unpaid internships anywhere in the world and it's not a big deal.  Then some students, maybe they're not doing that internship because they have to work to actually pay for their expenses, and they need to live at home to save money, so they don't have as many places where they can work.  So that's a very real issue.  //  INTERVIEWER:    Let's say hypothetically you could be the dean of student life here at Tufts.  What types of improvements would you like to see made on campus?    PARTICIPANT:    Gosh.  I don't know.  I think that because I don't really know that much about other schools it's hard for me to compare, like, this is what it could look like.  This is how it could be better.  I know little specific things that relate to my life that I would want to change.  I would love it if there was an outside organization that facilitates the Catholic student fellowship thing, or I would love it if this one thing in the senate policy was changed so that my organization could get more money, or I would love it if Tufts Christian Fellowship wasn't derecognized by our student government right now.       But in terms of overall things, I don't know because I don't know how things could be different.  It's just the way it is.  I don't know.  //  INTERVIEWER:    Do you think in general it's important to go to college?    PARTICIPANT:    Yeah, I think so.    INTERVIEWER:    Why?    PARTICIPANT:    It really depends on the person and their goals and stuff, because not everyone from where I come from, in my home schooling community or whatever, goes to college.  Well, it's interesting because I've realized a difference between me and some of my friends.  My friends think that if there's something that their self-worth comes from or something that means, ""I am a successful person,"" some of my friends think that that thing is their career and their success in their career.    I've never had that pressure from my parents at all.  My mom doesn't give a damn what I do.  My mom wants me to get married and have a family.  So I felt a little bit more pressure from that, and I think that me being successful or me being happy will come from me having a happy family life.    So I don't think that you have to pressure yourself to succeed academically and to go to a really prestigious college or to go to college at all, if you can support your family and be happy without it.  But I think that in a lot of circumstances it does make sense to go to college, but also, if it's super-expensive and you don't have the grades to get a really good scholarship, then maybe it's not the best thing.      But for me personally, again, something that I think a lot about is finding somebody who I can start a family with.  So I wouldn't want to marry somebody who didn't go to college and who isn't of the same academic background sort of as me.  I probably wouldn't marry somebody who went to community college either.  A lot of my friends from home are like that.  It's become part of who I am and how I can relate to people I think.  //  PARTICIPANT:    I don't know how I feel about the term every college student.  I don't know.  I think there are a lot of different types of college students.  Do you mean like a Tufts and a Harvard and a Georgetown student or do you mean like a -?    INTERVIEWER:    No one has really asked about that.  I mean just educational experiences that you think maybe every college student should have the opportunity to have.    PARTICIPANT:    Yeah.  For example, I think that study abroad is super-awesome.  I learned so much from studying abroad.  But that's not something that I think everybody - it's not realistic and it's a very privileged thing to suggest that everybody should do that.  //  INTERVIEWER:    What about the administration?  What do you think their goals are for students?    PARTICIPANT:    In the big picture of things they want students to graduate, to be successful so that eventually they're in either prestigious or lucrative positions, and then they give back to the university and it continues in a cycle.  That's how, I think, the university sustains itself and stuff, through both its reputation and donations and stuffs, grants or whatever.  So I think that's why they actually have an economic incentive to invest in their students' health and invest in how much the students enjoy their college experience and love their university.    //"

Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And I think that's very unique, um, to colleges. In general, it just creates a sense of community that is unlike anything else.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, what was the que- ... I can't remember the original question so I can elaborate on that.  Interviewer:	Sure. Um, the benefits of living on a college campus.  Interviewee:	The benefits. Okay. Um, the sense of community, um, the ... You get thrown into being an adult pretty quickly.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, and so you have to create the social skills where, um, you're no longer relying on your parents or, um, or maybe if you're not relying on people you know. You, you kind of to college and you don't necessarily know anyone. You have to rely on yourself. You have to become mature enough to have, um, mature interactions with people. Um, and I think through going into college and then thrown into it and just having, uh, that abrupt change, you're able to mature very quickly.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Okay. And let's see. So in general, would you say it's important to go to college?  Interviewee:	I think in American society, yes.  Interviewer:	Okay. And can you tell me more about that?  Interviewee:	Um, I know that the way capitalistic system is set up that we usually need a, um, college degree to, uh, to get enough money to live comfortably.   Interviewer:	Uh-huh. Okay.  Interviewee:	Usually.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. And so does that mean that it's-, there's some people it's less important for and not or is it for everyone you think equally important?  Interviewee:	Um, I don't think it's for everyone. Um, but I, I think that's more because the atmosphere that college provides necessarily, um, the importance, the emphasis on, um, getting a grade, which is what a lot of college feels like right now.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Whereas, um, if you just went straight into the workforce, you would be making money right off the back instead of paying, uh, 56,000 and go to college for a year.  // Interviewer:	Or no. Sort of what's ... Um, in what ways should they be transformed over their four years?  Interviewee:	Um, the maturity level I think is very important.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, freshman in general have a, uh, a continuation of high school almost kind of maturity level.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, and that's something that, that doesn't really work in the real world. Um, so maturity is definitely something, uh, how we should chain. Um, just keep coming back to money and being able to understand how money works in the real world and how to save and spend healthily, all of that.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Um, so, when you were applying to schools, why did you end up choosing OSU over other places that you might have been considering?]    Um, mainly cost.    Like I'm almost, almost primarily cost. Like it's, it's a good school um, like it's, like you know it's not like a bad school at all. It's like a pretty good school. Um but I, you know, I got schools that I would rather have attended but I just wasn't able to afford to go there, out of state.//[So what do you think are some of the main benefits for you of being able to live on a college campus?]    Uh (laughing) I mean, honestly I'm not too happy with my dorm-    Because I'm like ... I'm paying way more money than I would be if I could live off campus. Um, I, I think that's, for most people I think that the dorm is, is, is nice for them, um, in a sense that they can make friends and, and, and stuff, but I think for me, honestly I'd rather just be able to live on, uh, in an apartment you know and save myself some money.  //Now, and then the fourth thing is to learn to live independently because I think that it's rather difficult for college to teach a student how to live independently because in the dorm you're really not living independently I, I would say.    I, I, I, I honestly just think the dorms are like, kind of a money making enterprise for the school because like, I mean especially for Ohio State like I have to pay, the amount I have to pay for seven months to live in a little box-    Is equivalent to what uh, I could live year-round, uh and have $700 a month to spend on rent.    Uh, which is most of my spends, friends spend like $450 and they have like 3 other roommates and they have a house.    Um, so, so and like like the, the dining plan like, so like we have like swipes and stuff.    And so like I got unlimited swipes, unlimited swipes is say like, $1,800, um but then when you're upperclassmen which, because of like the AP credits I took like I'm an upperclassmen next year, um you can get this declining balance um, plan.    And it's really interesting because to set, so the declining balance plan is, it starts like cost, and then it says um, how much money is our dining dollars. The cost is like $2,000 and then I get 1,300 dining dollars back, which is just like, that just sounds like pure like, like robbery at that point. Like I, I'm giving you $2,000 and then you're gonna give me $1,300 back?    It's just that, that ... So, so I don't think to, to learn to live independently, I don't think that that's, that's more like a parental thing if anything, like I don't know.    I think lots of people learn how to live independently without going to college, in fact a majority of Americans learn to do that so.//"

They're kind of in between faculty and in between faculty and parents. They want you to be able to get a job, I'm sure. But at the same time, they know that college is more than just being able to get a job once you graduate.    35:20 S1: So, when you say you don't like administration because you feel like they suck money out of you, can you say more about that? What is it that gives you that feeling?     35:29 S2: I've just had a lot of people that have had... I just know a lot of people that have had problems with people in the administration positions telling them that yes, all their courses will be done on time, yes if you take this course you'll get your degree, and then things falling through and you have to stay an extra semester, but then the course that you want isn't available until the spring semester. So you end up having to do two semesters.

Tell me about the first one. So to get a job, why is that the most important of the four?     41:38 S2: Because we are paying a lot of money to be here.

But for example I know, within our department, um, you know we have, we don't have an Americanist or an Islamist, um, we have a few contemporary artists, [Durans 00:21:11] and um ...    	So it's, you know, making sure that there's ... there are funds to have a wider variety of professors who specialize in a wider array of um ... fields, things like that. Um ... in terms of, well, you know, more from the students perspective, I think that sometimes it can be hard to know how much is out there at Ohio State.    	And that, you know, it's difficult for a university to affect that, because there are so many things, and they can only, you know, tell students about so many things, um, over and over again, before they really, you know, they wrap their hea -- heads around it.

656,86,School 5,Medium Importance,Seniors,"CONTEXT It seems clear that the participant has not had to cut corners or be weighed down in a significant way by a lack of funds. From the quotes, it seems unlikely that the participant qualified for or is receiving financial aid or is working, but he is nonetheless concerned about the impact of finances and seems particularly aware of the kind of privilege that this entails. This strikes me as unusual. // QUOTES "" Oh yeah. Just like the economic disparity between... That you look at just for degrees alone makes it just the logical move. And I really value my college experience very highly, particularly the kind of education I got there especially in critical thinking I guess, like more broadly, most broadly. But also just general knowledge, or just being exposed to a bunch of different kinds of people and ideas. So it is... I think it is very important. And I'd like to say it's very important to get the kind of education that Kenyon offers, but at the same time it's a pretty closed-off kind of education. But still it's just... You're just better off having a degree than not. And it's always better to try to expose yourself to more ideas and different kinds of people in the world.    02:47 S1: And when you say... Sorry, to the effect, but I have to ask questions like this. When you say it's a kind of closed-off education, what do you mean by that?     02:53 S2: It's very expensive and impractical in some ways. I feel like... Part of the reason I value a liberal arts education so much is because I feel like it's not valued very much anymore, broadly speaking, and not by everybody. And I found a lot of people at Kenyon who of course value it a lot. But it's like in the workplace, it seems to me like it's... When I'm looking for jobs right now, it's often important that you have... I don't know, have had like this kind of internship or can like do this kind of computer programming or something like that. It's more about sort of practical skills. And Kenyon is very expensive. And it's really abhorrently expensive. And most people cannot afford to sort of intellectually dillydally like that. If you're a first-generation college student, it's not practical I think to go to a place like Kenyon. It would be more practical to go to your public university and get a degree that can help you get a job, because you don't have any kind of cushion. Whereas I do, to be honest, like..."" // ""Well, I mean, maybe not that you should be asking students, I mean, like my biggest concern with just the education in general is that I think that, I'm really grateful for the education I've gotten, and the kind of education that I've gotten, and I really, and it's really frustrating to me that it had to cost my parents, 200, whatever thousand dollars to do that because I think, because... I don't know. It just, it's not, it's just like, why is it so much harder to do that, than to teach kids how to be an engineering student. But, it is like a really, really good liberal arts education with good faculty, is just disgustingly expensive. And I just, and I don't know what students would say about that, but that's just broadly speaking, that's an important, that's just like a disturbing thing about colleges. And like, it just speaks to inequality in general, but like, it's just so goddamn expensive. I mean like, really astronomically expensive. Like, not just pretty expensive, but like years of salaries for many families. And many middle class families expensive.    16:09 S1: We had somebody explain it to us, like, it's like buying a house.    16:14 S2: Yeah.    16:15 S1: And when you try to figure out what school you wanna go to, you're trying to figure out what house you can afford and that's kind of what it comes down to sometimes.    16:22 S2: Yeah, and like... I don't think the financial aid system is all that good. One of my friends didn't get as much financial aid as they wanted because one of the assets on his parents house was this, like, decrepit but overvalued house that they, his parents had inherited from their parents when they died, that they didn't really know what to do with 'cause they were like, ""How to sell it?"" 'cause it's like a weird, old, decrepit, place and it's in a location, but that's listed on their assets.    16:53 S1: Yeah.    16:54 S2: And so they didn't get as much financial aid largely because that house is valued at like 200 something and... So there are problems with even financial aid, too, even when they're trying to apply it, so... Yeah, and again, I don't know, like, how you would ask kids about that, but to me, just like...    17:17 S1: Because, yeah, one of the things we do is just see if it comes up, and see if they bring it up."""

And you aren't gonna, you're just gonna you know, take it for what it is. So that's, well, that was a big motivator for me, to be able to talk about all this. And it is, like, i think it is kinda like nice.//[Mm-hmm (affirmative). And when you commuted, um, you mentioned a little bit of like the downsides of that, were, were there any other downsides to commuting, or any positives as well?]    Well, the biggest positive with commuting was that I could live with my parents and save a bunch of money, and besides that, there's not really very many positives, I think. But, so, another negative I guess of commuting would be that ...    Yeah, I mean, I guess it's just the opposite of the positives. It's harder to access campus, it's harder to use the resources, it's harder to meet up with people, it's harder to do all these things.//"

And that was super intimidating. Like I'm glad that I had my parents to help me with that.

And do you think it's important to go to college?     05:34 S2: I do. This could be just part of how I was raised but I was always raised with a very awareness on importance on education and getting into a good college. But when you talk to people and say that you go to a prestigious school, there's a certain reaction you get which shouldn't be the reason you choose that school. But at the same time, it's impressive and it'll help you make connections with people or I guess everyone's ultimate goal is to get a career that they love or can provide them the lifestyle that they want and sometimes going to college can help you do that.    06:13 S1: Yeah. Do you think there's anyone for whom it's not important to go to college?     06:18 S2: Wait, can you repeat it? Sorry.    06:19 S1: Yeah, that's fine.

Just like I know the independence, a lot of kids are like, ""Well, I'll do whatever I want. I could skip class if I want to.""

I was on the fence between low and medium, but the interviewer and I both wondered if the main reason he's commuting is financial (he doesn't say so, but he does say he wishes he could live on campus), so I went with medium.  //  QUOTES: 0:03:25 S1: Yeah. Why are you a commuter... Commuting student?     0:03:28 S2: Why am I a commuting student? That's a good question. Every year, it's always like, ""Why don't you live on campus? Why don't you live on campus?"" It just doesn't appeal to me as much and maybe the fact that I don't know enough to just be like, ""Oh, living on campus is a fantastic thing."" But you have this idea that there's a college experience always on campus and if you're a commuter student, you don't get that experience the same way, right? So again, I'm saving money, first of all, each semester. And, I love living at home and I have great relationship with my parents. It's only a 30-minute drive, too. So those are a bunch of pluses, and they give me great support. And as far as living on campus, you kind of have a picture what it would be like, but I'm here a lot of the day anyway and commuting, so I've now adjusted that to my daytime schedule each and every day traveling back and forth from home to Raymond, to here on campus and doing all these different things. So I don't know, I wish I could live on campus, but at the same time, I continue to like what I'm doing now.    0:04:43 S1: Okay. So just not to press the issue, but I'm just curious. Was it more of a cost-saving decision or more of a decision about what you wanted to do?     0:04:56 S2: I would say more... I don't think it would be... I don't even think it would be either the cost, or what I would want more. It really wouldn't matter to me, personally. Like, there was all sorts of these things going on, like, ""Oh, I could stay at home, and be a great advantage to myself, but you know, you'd have to get to the commute."" And then maybe I wouldn't like living on campus. Maybe I wouldn't care for a roommate or maybe... That kind of stuff. I mean, it would be less stressful, obviously, too, maybe, maybe not. But I don't think that'd be a deciding factor either way.  //  0:23:31 S2: I do think it's important to go to college. I always think about this kind of thing, too. It's important because even... No, I would say more like college is a risk, actually.    0:23:43 S1: College is a risk?     0:23:43 S2: College is a risk. You're putting yourself in a place where you are trying to find out who you are, what you're interested in, and it's up to you to be able to pursue that at your own way. It's a risk in effect that you are spending your time here instead of out in the workforce. However, by doing so, there is a great advantage to being here as well. You're taking the time to really pace yourself and study and work towards a higher education, to work towards a higher paying job or some sort of career, I should say. Not working at some sort of fast food joint or something for 40 hours a week. So, it is a risk, maybe you will come away great or maybe you won't, and you'll just change it up if you have to.  //  0:55:45 S1: What do you think parents would say about the goals of the college experience?     0:55:52 S2: Work for something that you're really passionate about. You're here and you want to pursue something that you really, really enjoy. You're passionate about it, you want to pursue that the rest of your life, you want to get your career, you're gonna make maybe a lot of money out of it, maybe not.

But if you wanna do something more mainstream, and have a backup plan, I guess, then I think it's a good thing to have, but it's not right for everybody. If you know you're not gonna do well, don't waste a bunch of money going. And you can always go back, it's not like college is going anywhere. // 15:35 S1: I really like the fact that everything is accessible.

They kinda make a decision about where that money should go, that type of thing.    0:55:47 S2: What do I think their mindset is?     0:55:49 S1: What do you think their goals are for students? What do you think that they want students to get out of the college experience?     0:55:56 S2: I feel like, I don't know. 'Cause in my mindset, where I've seen a lot of the money go, I don't necessarily know if it's always for the students. I feel like it's more for the university in and of itself to get more funding, to get more people to come here, to get more money, which I guess in the long run is to improve UNH. But sometimes I just see money that they spent, what was it? A $100,000 on a new school logo? Like...    0:56:25 S1: I heard a lot of gripes about that.    0:56:27 S2: Like it was just... And they said... I don't even know. It was like... I'm okay with the logo, but it's nothing special. $100,000 for something that I could have drawn. You know what I mean?

Or have the student win like $1000. That also would incorporated a much more like sense of pride as to our logo like a student made this not some...

I don't really see much thinking about the students. Like maybe as a whole, ""Yes, we're going to need more money to make this place better."" But that's I feel like in my mind just to make more money to make more money.  //  0:59:22 S2: 'Cause, at least I started off in a dorm. You have RAs that monitor you, are there to make sure you're okay. You have a dining room. And then as you like go up through the years, eventually, your own house, worry about rent, bills. You're definitely more off on your own.

If you're the type of person where you're very job oriented, you know you want a job to make a lot of money, that's gonna be like where you're spending a lot of your time then. I think that... Like could you like re-read the question again? I'm sorry.    1:01:57 S1: In what role do you think that the UNH experience most prepares you for in the future, so your role, what role in your society or your community?     1:02:07 S2: Yeah, okay. So on that single note I would say that it prepares you as to how to do work, how to manage your time, how to get things done effectively and definitely whereas you have the other mindset, this is more my mindset, where it's sort of like I wanna go into the real world to get a job definitely but have, get a job so I have money to enjoy myself when I'm not working, to be able to go have crazy experiences with my friends, see my family when I want. And I think for me college has shown me how to, and is still showing me how to sort of manage all of that more outside, like all different facets of your life.  //  1:04:02 S1: Why do you feel like they fit in that order?     1:04:08 S2: Well, the job because that's why everyone really is going to college.

And, um, people have sort of grown to get very mad and angry at them. Um, I also feel the same way with Greek organizations. Uh, the way, uh, our dining hall is set up because we only have one dining hall, um, there are, are two sides of the dining hall, um, and one side has a bunch of circular tables. Uh, and the other one has long, uh, straight bench tables. Um, and so basically what ends up happening is that all of the Greek organizations and the athletes are on the long table is on the one side.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	That is what it's like. And they sit like that. And it makes sense because they wouldn't all be able to fit at, um, at a circular table on the other side of, of the dining hall.

Interviewee:	Like which side of the dining hall do you sit on?

And, and if I understood you correctly, the students get angry at those who participate in athletics or Greek life if I understood you correctly. Do you know what, what the tension is about or the division?  Interviewee:	Um, I think, um, it's really like the attitudes, uh, of the ... Hm. I guess I'll say this in a different way. A lot of, uh, students who don't partake in athletics, they also believe that like we shouldn't be spending so much money on athletics.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And that like it's sort of useless. Like I didn't come to the school to go and cheer for a losing football team. So why are we spending so much money on football? I don't know. And then the football team may act like they're really cool and doing some great stuff because they're athletes. They're representing the school but like everyone else just views that as like a waste of our tuition.  	Um, so yeah, I think, I think that has, uh, a big thing to do with it is that like a lot of students didn't come here for sports and they don't think like care about sports at all.

It depends on what your goal is for what you wanna do with your life. If you don't wanna be doing something where you're a CEO or heading something up, like for manual labor, it's... I think it's important that everyone has a good education, but I think with the way the financials work out, it doesn't make sense to go, not throw away your money, but invest it in something that where you could be investing it, like if you have fiscal needs now, you have to be really realistic about that. // 17:11 S2: Freshman year, I really liked living together in the freshman community.

To group it together, I'd hate to group things together, but paying for their own education, understanding that potentially you could be drafted, that you had just come back from war, I think you matured a lot more quickly, and I think that's apparent, especially on campuses now, again like I was saying, it's sort of like camp in the way that universities have all these activities for you to do, just lined up, that they're kind of baby-ing us.

If you want to, like, go into a profession or something that doesn't require college education, then, like, don't bother, I guess? (laughs).

And why did you chose UNH over the some of the other schools that you may have been looking at?    Interviewee:	Honestly, it was kind of a money choice.  Because, the other– I applied to a couple big schools in Boston, and they were like 60, 64,000 a year.  And, it was a lot cheaper to go in-state school.  And they gave me pretty good financial help.      So I figured it would be better for me to go here, considering I mean, I’d get pretty equal education either place, so I thought it’d be smarter to come out of school with less debt.  //  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm.  Okay.  What about classes that might be what you would consider to be wastes of time?    Interviewee:	I took a classical mythology class and that’s been kind of a waste.  I can’t really drop it because I need a certain amount of classes to be a considered a full-time student, and I have to maintain that for scholarships and stuff like that.  But, I haven’t found it very interesting.  And it’s been kind of just memorizing facts and not a lot of interaction in that class, so.  //  Interviewer:	So, on every campus, in our interviews, we’re also going to be speaking with other groups of people, so for instance parents and faculty, administrators, alumni, trustees, and job recruiters.  So I’m going to ask you what each of these groups might say about the goal of the college experience.  So we’ll start with parents.  What do you think, if I asked parents of UNH students what the goal of the college experience is, what do you think they would say?

Interviewee:	Oh, um, I mean technically yes but I don't think I would have liked it. Um, especially for like how expensive it is to go to Duke I would've been frustrated [inaudible 00:20:21] paying my classes online.    "" // ""Interviewer:	Like, like in general. Like what do you think are the biggest problems on campus?    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, so I think one thing that bothers me a lot is the lack of socioeconomic diversity but not in the traditional sense. Um, I think that the school, in an effort to create socioeconomic diversity actually creates a polarized environment so, you know, you have the, you have the kids up here who are full pay, then you have the kids down here who are, you know, are receiving financial aid and then there's a gap here where there's people, you know, there's a few people in the middle but most people who are in here they're just not at Duke. Um, because, you know their parents aren't going to pay or they can't pay or whatever.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Um, and so the school is saying you can pay, I don't know, $40,000 a year and the parents are saying they can't. The kid doesn't really have a choice unless they want to take out loans. So, you go somewhere else. So I think it, it almost creates like it creates a ... And then, as a result there's a, there's this big divide. You know there's the kids who are, you know, driving around in the BMW, they have fancy clothes and, you know, whatever. They don't have to worry about money and then there's the kids who, you know, yeah they have financial aid and all that but they can't go out to eat with, you know the kids up here and, um, there's, there's just ... I think it's a problem.    	Um, I also think it's a problem that, you know, I have very few friends at Duke or very just strictly middle class. You know, there's lower class and then there's upper middle class to upper class but there's no middle class, upper middle class, you know like the lower end of it. Um ...    Interviewer:	That's really funny that it would end up being like that.    Interviewee:	Yeah and, but, but then it, it makes sense when you think about the system because you know if your parents make, I don't know, $200,000 or more unless you live somewhere crazy like California or New York you're not really going to qualify for much aid but like can they necessarily afford to pay $16,000 a year? No.    Interviewer:	Yeah, yeah.    Interviewee:	You know? Um, and then so it's interesting because there's a big push right now to, amongst students, to make Duke follow the path of our peer institutions where there's no loans and part of financial aid but I don't think that that's the solution because right now I think the maximum loan, uh, if your parents pay their part of their estimated pay on the contribution the maximum, um, loan whatever of students is $5,000 a year, so $20,000 which I mean it's a lot of money but, um, I don't think that it's something that would necessarily inhibit somebody from coming to a top 10 university whereas um, you know the kid who's not receiving aid who's just stuck in the middle ...    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Where they're expected to pay the full thing. They're not coming.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	And so that ... It creates this, this awkward divide and then tuition is so high for the people who are full pay that they're all bitter about it. Um, not all of them but, you know, a big chunk of them ...    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Are bitter about it and then they're hating on the system which is inherently a good system because without it there wouldn't be anybody who wasn't upper middle class to upper class so I just think it's a huge mess. Um (Laughs)    Interviewer:	Yeah that sounds like it's ...    Interviewee:	Yeah and like ...    Interviewer:	Um ...    Interviewee:	Like the, the school doesn't seem to ... It's not something that's talked about that much but it just ... It seems like something that could be improved upon. Um, and like there was, uh, there was a column in the New York Times awhile ago, I think it was called Making College Cheaper or something like that which sort of laid out what I think would be a reasonably good solution to this problem. Um, because it would, um, essentially rather than rely so much on grants as, you know, need based grants it would be more of a, um, like a school backed loan. So then, um, which it would be lowered for everybody and, um, and, um students who, you know can pay it they pay it. Students who can't they get a loan from the school that if they go into something where they wouldn't be able to pay it back the school essentially eats the cost, sort of like what law schools do in that, you know, if you go into public interest work the school will cover your loans.    	It'd be something like that but then the cost would be lower. Some people would have to take out less loans and then people in the middle class would be less precluded, um, from coming to a school like Duke.

I think one would be to, uh, would be to just like be, take risks when it comes to taking classes. Um, don't let, don't let something like a certain job that you want or wanting to have a certain income or wanting to get into a certain you know med school, law school, whatever influence what you do in college. Um, you know for example like people who want to go to med school tend to major in biology or chemistry or it's like you know I have a friend, he's only, he's going to be a junior next year but he's majoring in sociology and he wants to go to med school and hell he's probably going to be better off when it comes time to apply for med school because what's going to stick out on his application? The fact that he's a sociology major, you know and it's like something that'll set him apart.    "" // ""Interviewer:	So I have one more rank order question.    Interviewee:	Okay.    Interviewer:	And this one is about why it's important to go to college.    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, okay. So I think to get a job is four. Um, to learn to live independently is three. Um, to study a particular content area in depth is two and then, um, to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge and the world is one.    Interviewer:	And tell me about why you see them fitting in the order that they do. I mean I think I can guess why you chose the first one but maybe the other three.    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, so I mean to learn and live independently like what the heck? I think that most people once you hit 18 if you're not going to college your parents aren't going to keep treating you like you're in high school. You know, you're going to have to start to branch off and do what you're going to do. Um, and if anything I think going to college, at least for me, I mean it didn't really teach me independence. You know, I wasn't making money. I was still on my parents dime, I was still ... And I think most people are, you know, because you have to be because you don't have time to get a job and support yourself. Um, so you're either on your parents dime or you're on the schools dime through financial aid.    "" // ""Um, and then I guess I mean number, number one I just, I just think that's what college is all about. Um, and the problem I think is that people lose sight of that but like ultimately that, and that's what I've gotten out of it, that's what I wanted to get out of it. I think that's what makes it so special. Yeah, you can make a lot of money without going to college. You can, you know, especially now that college is so expensive the money that you've spent on college you could invest that in a business and do, you know, phenomenally well financially but they would just be like, uh, void in your existence.""    // ""Interviewer:	And then what about, um, parents of students? Do you think that they would rank these the same?    Interviewee:	No, I think it would be very different.    Interviewer:	Oh.    Interviewee:	Um, because I think, I think a lot of parents ... I think like to get a job would be number one for, for many parents because they just think their kid would be ... When they think of get a job they think of it as you need to get a job of a certain caliber. Um, and then I think, um, to learn to live independently I think a lot of parents think that their kid is living independently when they're at college so like they would put that as number two.    	Um, so like I obviously went to ... I'm going to law school next year and I went to like admitted students weekend and I, it was three hour away and I drove up by myself and stayed there, you know, whatever. Like kind of what I would expect to do as a 22 year old, you know, about to go to law school and this one mom says to me, ""Wow, you're so independent!"" And I'm sitting there thinking okay so I'm driving the car that my parents bought for me and you know I'm staying in a hotel that my parents are subsidizing, you know what I mean? So it's like am I really independent just because I can travel from (Laughs) you know make a three hour drive?    Interviewer:	[crosstalk 00:56:14] Yeah.    Interviewee:	Yeah, you know like I'm not being independent so like it showed and I don't ... I think that may not have been like, you know the norm but I think that like a lot of, you know that kind of showed me yeah it looks like Independence but is it really independence? Um, so I think they would say two because it's just getting them from under their roof but they don't realize that like there is so much dependence still there.    ""    // ""Interviewer:	In what ways do you notice a difference in how their experience has changed them and how your experience has been a difference for you? Are there any distinctions?    Interviewee:	Hmm, that is a tough one. Um, I think that there, there's definitely distinctions. Um, but it's hard for me to capture what exactly they are, you know what I mean? Like I think, I think that because, because of the things that I mentioned at the beginning that, you know, why I chose Duke, you know things like smaller class sizes I'd say that the population at Duke is a bit more diverse because you know if I had gone to Michigan yeah it's a pretty diverse as far as state schools go, you know they have a lot of people from other states, from internationally but still ...    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	I mean I'm making this number up but I bet you 50% of students come from Michigan at least. Um, same with like a school like UVA. You know they're getting students from all over the place but still a big chunk of them come from Virginia. Um, and so like I think that that makes it a little bit harder to gain the different perspectives on people because even though they still have things like socioeconomic diversity, racial diversity, et cetera like when half the people are from the same state, let alone the same country it ... I think that that, um ...    Interviewer:	Kind of hinders that experience?    Interviewee:	Yep, yeah.    "" // ""Interviewer:	Um, and then in thinking about Duke and your experience, um, where there any things that kept you up at night?    Interviewee:	Kept me up at night? Um, well I mean schoolwork but, uh (Laughs) you mean just like really bothered me?    Interviewer:	Yeah, were there any things that really bugged you, that made you worry?    Interviewee:	Um, I guess one thing just at Duke that just frustrated me was that I always ... Not always, but a lot of the time I felt like I had been nickel and dimed in that the university didn't appreciate, um, didn't really appreciate like what message certain things were sending, so something like they charged us for laundry and I'm sitting here thinking, you know, so you're telling me that after paying $60,000 a year essentially between tuition, room and board that you can't throw the laundry in? You know what I mean? Or, um, you know they changed the printing policy this year so that, um, like if you ... They give you a free printing allocation and then if you run out you couldn't just refill it like you could in the past, you know you could refill it $8 but then you couldn't refill it beyond that. It's like yeah, not that big of a deal but it's like if I need to print for, you know, my academics at this university where I'm paying so much money to go here I feel like that should just be included. Um ...    Interviewer:	Is it like somebody there trying to be green so they didn't want people printing as much?    Interviewee:	So, so that was the stated reason but then ultimately like I think there would have been other solutions to, to curb that. You know, so look at people's printing history, so like I was doing a lot of big projects this year. I wasn't printing textbooks you know you, you could look at my printing history and tell the difference and I think that would be the case for a lot of people and their, their claim was that people don't use it, most people don't use it any - don't use all their printing anyways so it's not a big deal but it's like so if that's the case then why even change the policy?    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Um, and then I mean I think other little things like when, when it's parent's weekend if your parents want to come to campus, um, you know they have to pay like $150 or $200 for, you know, it's like a parking pass and like whatever and I'm sitting there thinking so a parent wants to come and see their kid, see, you know, what their kid is talking about, what they're making sacrifices for by 99% of people sending their kid to a school like this are making sacrifices of some sort. Um, and then you're going to charge them to have that experience? I just think it's ridiculous.    	Um, but otherwise I mean I've been very happy overall. I haven't, I haven't been kept up at night about much. Like I would just ... I was so thankful that to be there, you know and to have such a good experience. Um, so I, I think it was good.

Interviewee:	And it's been super helpful in helping me like achieve those goals, but I think I started too late and the problem is, and this was explained to me by my, like high management tutor, is they don't have the resources that for every student to have a time management counselor. And so, what ends up happening is only the students that are truly failing in managing their time are reaching out.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Do these people, um, but like I wasn't really failing at managing my time for the first few years of college but things like started piling up.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And eventually it was bad and if I'd had someone from the get-go that was just like a person I could go to, like I didn't have to go to, but that I knew I could go to ...    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, would have really, really helped me.    Interviewer:	Yeah, so can you tell me a little bit more about that program that offers the time management counseling and sort of how it's been advertised, what it is, how you found out about it?    Interviewee:	Sure, so, um, I ... One day, I was Googling because, um, I was looking up counseling like therapy for my friend in Indiana.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	And (laughs) in Indiana they have ... they pay for, uh, full, like full treatment indefinitely.    Interviewer:	Wow.    Interviewee:	And then I was like, ""This is crazy,"" and then my friend was like, ""Hey, do this for like everything."" Like they have like physical training and like time management like all this different ... Like I don't even remember if time management was one of them but I remember that like they ... this is a really long story, but yeah they, um, pay for like personalized ... Anyway, personalized different forms of counseling. So I was like, ""Does Tufts have this?"" And I just typed in Tufts counseling and it was like half mental health services and then there was also like, uh, time management counseling. And I was like, ""Ha, this is like exactly what I need.""    Interviewer:	Great.    Interviewee:	That's basically what happened.  //  Interviewer:	Okay. Cool. Um, so, okay, I'm gonna skip a question. Okay. So you mentioned that- that's something you really wish you kind of had access to from the beginning. Um, I wanna know if I were to put you in charge of the entire academic program at Tufts, so anything relating to curriculum, courses, academic program in general, you're now the Czar, what are three changes you would wanna make to what's in place?    Interviewee:	Like the full academic program?    Interviewer:	Yeah, this could really be anything. (laughs)    Interviewee:	Um, Okay, So I think, this is really hard. (laughs)    Interviewer:	Yeah, it is.    Interviewee:	I think, the first thing should be ... more job security for professors and more tenure track for professors.    Interviewer:	Oka. Okay.    Interviewee:	Um, because ... Oh, and, I guess ... well I guess this, this would just be professors in general. Um, does it make sense that they have to go like teach a bunch of classes and do a shit ton of research like at the same time? Because like ... oh, their priorities are like constantly shifting.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, so, uh, like the thing is ... the, the reason I'm having trouble is because I'm identifying the problems but I don't really necessarily see what the solutions are.    Interviewer:	Right. Okay.    Interviewee:	And I feel like there are a lot of people that are super angry with like their deans or like, like I had a very good academic experience at Tufts.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And so, because of that the way I look at the situation is, um ... I want there to be more professors like the professors I really enjoy.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And so profess- the part time professors that I really enjoyed and like the lectures that I really enjoyed, there's no reason that they shouldn't be full time professors.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And then so just ultimately academics is always tied to the financial side of things.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	That will be ... I think Tufts endowment needs to be like expanded or like not endowment but whatever ... I don't know if teachers are paid through the endowment but, um, just more money self-act.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	So Tufts lost a lot of money through like doing stupid shit, giving money to Bernie Madoff.    Interviewer:	What was that?    Interviewee:	Tufts gave money to Bernie Madoff.    Interviewer:	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. All right, any other like changes or ... Sorry, what was that?    Interviewee:	Not very smart decisions.    Interviewer:	Oh, not very smart decisions. Um, are there any other changes or problems you wanna talk about in regards to that sort of academic program question?    Interviewee:	Um, not that I can think of.  //  Interviewer:	Okay. And then, um, I just wanna know, thinking more generally again, is it important to go to college and why or why not do you think so?    Interviewee:	Yeah, uh, it really depends on what you wanna do in life.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, I think it also depends on when you're looking at. Like, I don't know if college will be important in like 50 years, but like right now it is important to go to college.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Can you expand on that a little?    Interviewee:	So, I think that ... if you wanna accept school without going to college, you really have to be super specialized in one thing.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	And the one thing has to bring you a lot of money.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Be as well versed or intelligent in other things because, sure you can read a book but you might not have developed the critical thinking that you would have.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And you put those in exposed from many cultures and world views and like different ideas.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Now there's such ... and I guess this all circles back to liberal arts ... but like, if you get the whole liberal arts experience then you're base is really primed for reading books, learning other ideas cause you have, you have such a library in your head I guess.    Interviewer:	Yeah, yeah great, and so what do you think about it not maybe being important 50 years from now?    Interviewee:	Um, so I think it's probably in a bubble because looking in prices are rising-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... really fast. Like constantly rising, rising, rising. And so, when it'll get too expensive for middle class Americans-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... to go to college, we're gonna start, like there's going to be a social movement. I do like protests, or strikes, or like, and like, obviously politicians are going to have to support it because most people who are voting are, um ... middle class. And so, what will end up happening is either, colleges will get less expensive and everyone's going to go, or people are just gonna skip out on colleges and develop other forms of education we don't know about yet.  //  Interviewer:	Cool. Um, okay and so what are some of the resources, programs, major activities at Tufts that are in place, that help students make the most of their experience?    Interviewee:	Um, there are a lot of like, programming orgs-    Interviewer:	Okay-    Interviewee:	... that get noticed all the time. There's a pretty major advisor but like, I don't think it's about ... I'm not- I'm not a huge fan of that system.    Interviewer:	Okay, so, what is this system?    Interviewee:	You get like, a pre-major advisor and it's basically this person that doesn't know anything about Tufts and is just like some guy that Tufts hired two years ago to teach a subject, like basically there supposed to like help you develop your college- like your schedule and classes and everything-    Interviewer:	Okay-    Interviewee:	... and what you wanna do with your life, it's not- it's not a good system, these are not trained professionals.    Interviewer:	Okay, so they're just hired for that explicit person- purpose, they don't have another role on campus? Are they teaching?    Interviewee:	They're- they're professors.    Interviewer:	Oh- okay, (laughs) professors-    Interviewee:	(laughs)    Interviewer:	So they're not, yeah-    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	... they're not well trained, you're saying?    Interviewee:	They're so disconnected from administration-    Interviewer:	Okay, okay.    Interviewee:	... that it's, like, they look at it as unimportant.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	'Cause if they- 'cause they're so under trained, they have no choice but to look at it as unimportant.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	Um, I really wish that people were trained like the dean was and helping people figure out, for sure, what they wanna do with their lives.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	'Cause I feel like if that's not- if you ... if it ... if the end of college you don't know what you wanna do with your life, it's kind of a bad investment.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	But more and more, no one knows what they wanna do with their life-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... for sure. So,    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- and do you get randomly assigned to a pre-major advisor?    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Okay, so it doesn't matter sort of like, what subject they teach or anything?    Interviewee:	Yeah, mine was like Latin American studies.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- And then you mentioned like you feel like the dean is well-trained in helping students through that kind of thing, is that something from personal experience or that you're saying more generally?    Interviewee:	Yeah, I- I've- I have had a meeting with my dean and she knows the medium. She like explicitly knows like every single like step of the process-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... pre-major advisor like, only spoke in generalities, he was like, ""Yes, if you take a few of these, and a few of these you'll be great."" He thought of it as like a sure thing.    Interviewer:	All right, you- you cut out just a little bit-    Interviewee:	Oh, my bad.    Interviewer:	... can you hear me okay? You can hear me?    Interviewee:	Yeah-    Interviewer:	Okay-    Interviewee:	... Can you hear me?    Interviewer:	I can hear you now. So, I heard you say that when you did talk to your pre-major advisor about it, they were just saying, ""Take a few of these, take a few of these,"" and then I didn't quite hear what you said after that.    Interviewee:	Yeah, (laughs) take a few of these, take a few of these.    Interviewer:	(laughs) Yeah-    Interviewee:	... and he looked- he looked at it as like, a charity thing.    Interviewer:	A charity thing?    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Oh okay, okay.    Interviewee:	Like, I'm an adult helping these kids out with their lives.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- yeah, so you didn't like sort of the- the vibe of it and then the actual advice that you were being given?    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Okay, okay, that's good to know about. Um, and then have you had a good experience now that you have major advisors?    Interviewee:	Um, absolutely.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Yeah, my major advisors are incredible.    Interviewer:	And do you think it more has to do with the expertise or the role?    Interviewee:	They're just like, the best people all around. So it's just really, um ... it's- it's just like, like I said, if you trust the person then like, uh, whatever they suggest make them just good.  //  Interviewer:	Okay, that's a good answer. Cool, so I'm gonna switch gears a little bit and I wanna know, from your own perspective, what are sort of the biggest problems on Tufts campus or biggest concerns?    Interviewee:	So one, what ... so about biggest problems or concerns, from a global perspective? About the world or about Tufts campus?    Interviewer:	On-campus at Tufts.    Interviewee:	Okay. Um, divestment from bad stuff, there's a lot of pro-Israel, anti-Israel.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	But, it's really hard ... It's always tied to Tufts. Like, there's always like, the types of professors that Tufts hires, like, where Tufts is investing, it's like always tied to pro-Israel, anti-Israel.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	That comes up constantly, there's a lot of that happening.    Interviewer:	So you're- you see a tension between that, it's not like one way or the other?    Interviewee:	Yeah, for sure.  //  Interviewer:	... and what I want you to do is, I want you to rank these based on what you see as the most important problem or the biggest problem, sorry, on campus, and go down to the least important or the, um, smallest problem, based on what you observe at Tufts.    Interviewee:	All right, so the menta- I was wrong, the mental health one is definitely like, huge.    Interviewer:	Okay, and you-    Interviewee:	So-    Interviewer:	Yeah, you stated talking about, when you did your adjective one, so I do wanna hear more about those dynamics. I'm gonna ask you to walk through your thought process so you can either do that after you've ranked it or as you rank it.    Interviewee:	Sounds good. Uh, so you want me to give an adjective to each one?    Interviewer:	Oh, no, no, no, sorry. I was just bringing up, since you said, um, insecure as your adjective, I felt like you were kind of getting into the mental health stuff-    Interviewee:	Right, right.    Interviewer:	So, I wanna hear more about it, but I'm just saying, you can either give it to me right now, or you can just wait until you've ranked them all and then talk through each of them.    Interviewee:	Sounds good. Okay, I think I'm gonna rank them and then-    Interviewer:	Perfect-    Interviewee:	I'll-    Interviewer:	Thank you-    Interviewee:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- Uh, would you prefer I send these-    Interviewer:	Oh yeah, you can just say it out loud to me.    Interviewee:	Okay, cool. So, um, mental health is one-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Uh, sexual misconduct is two.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, relationship with peers is probably three.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Alcohol and substance abuse is four because it happens, but I- I don't see, not in like a problematic way.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, and then the academic dishonesty like, I- I see it rarely, and when it does happen, it's like kind of not real.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Okay, thanks for ranking that, and do you wanna maybe circle back and talk about some of those one you have ranked higher?    Interviewee:	Sure, um, so like it takes like, weeks to get an appointment at mental health services and um, it like ... which would suggest a few things. One, like, these are not trained ... like how- d- d ... If it- if it takes two weeks to get an appointment then they're not like, trained professionals 'cause if you're at the point where you're making a mental health appointment like, you're not gonna wait two weeks.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	And then two, the people funding them like, clearly don't understand this, so they don't have the resources to have more people to like, take more appointments like, it's not their fault.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	But we need to be more reserved as for sure-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Because, it's being- it's being treated like- like college is this insane transition, 'cause it's an insane amount of money, you have to decide what you wanna do, you have to pick all of these classes, you have to graduate on time. Like, all of these different things adding up and like everyone, is going through the same exact thing. There're are no resources to help with that. In addition, it's all of these like, relationships and like eh- there's, yeah there is substance abuse and there's sexual assault and all of these things are happening and it's happening to everyone, and it's being treated like a problem that only a few people go through.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	Um, it should- it should be like, peo- a lot of people look at it that's like mental illness re- like services but instead it should be ... people should go there just to keep themselves like good, you know?    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	'Cause it is such a stressful time.    Interviewer:	Yeah, absolutely. Um, and you kind of encompassed talking about relationships and sexual assault within that, but is there anything in particular that you've observed or you wanna say about those specific ones?    Interviewee:	Uh, yeah, like the culture request-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... do exist, public's really cracked down on it. Um, but it's, it was like horrible like pretty terrible. Yeah, and it's the- like a lot of stuff that would be considered like, war crimes, basically happened in [inaudible 00:41:43] so.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- okay, okay, thank you for that ranking. So, um, you've already kind of gotten into the next question, but I'm gonna ask it anyway. So, I wanna know who's helpful for students? Where would they go, who would they go to if they were dealing with these types of issues, and you decided to talk about the mental health counseling and I just wanna know if there's any other resources that are sort of coming to mind?    Interviewee:	Um, like the time management-    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Counseling, um, what's the ... Oh, I know, I mean there's tutoring for subjects-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... with people, um ...    Interviewer:	Also, yeah-    Interviewee:	Yeah-    Interviewer:	I was just gonna say, I'm just curious to hear a little bit more about the time management counseling, 'cause I personally haven't heard about it yet. Um, so what does it sort of consist of, and how has that been super helpful for you?    Interviewee:	So, it's basically like a one hour session a week-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... and you sit down and you first, you prioritize your own niche.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Find out wha- what you need to do, what's important, you make goals and then you learn how to, to kind of develop a routine.    Interviewer:	Okay, mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Stick to your goals.    Interviewer:	Cool, and so is that something you meet consistently with them?    Interviewee:	Yeah.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	So during finals it was like twice a week, but I went back to once a week.  //  Interviewer:	Okay, great, thanks for talking me through those and then just quickly, I did mention at the beginning of the interview that were gonna be talking to other constituent groups at Tufts. So, we're talking to other students, faculty, parents, do any of those groups stand out to you as maybe looking at this list and having a different ranking from your own or maybe a similar ranking for any of these items?    Interviewee:	Yeah, I mean, the people in finance consulting, um, engineering, more structured programs-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	... they get a job to be like number one, like, 'cause it's- it's always about the return on investment.  //  Interviewer:	Okay cool, and then thinking about your work and thinking about the school, what kinds of things, if any, are worrisome to you or keeping you up at night, if any?    Interviewee:	Um, just the insane price.  //  Interviewer:	Okay, great. All right, so, that is basically all I have for you today and I just wanna thank you again for, especially going over time and for giving me a time, and I just wanna know if there's anything else that we haven't touched upon in the interview that you would like to share about Tufts or the college experience, your own experience, or even elaborate upon that we only talked about a little bit.    Interviewee:	I think they're definitely needs to be guided.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	With the guidance counselor that's fully cranked that you're- just put you require to get to-    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	... from freshmen year. And if you don't like the person like you can like get another one like it doesn't matter. When you go off years and like you, you're paying so much money for the school you at least, like in all Tufts financial counselors or advisers like we need to have tons of thousands of dollars that we have to like spend it different like classes and like programs like all these stuff. And it's- I thinks someone that isn't just doing it as like a sci- thing and it's like their job to help you would really, really be helpful.  //  Interviewer:	Yeah, that's really valuable here now. And then very last thing, I just want to know how motivated you to participate and sign up for the interview today?    Interviewee:	Um, that's a good question and part of me wanted to reflect on my college experience and in fact know my own thoughts were because I didn't know what the questions were going to be and I didn't know what I was going to say. So like that's interestingly kind of develop that picture at my head.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	And then I was like, it's also worth my time because I'm making some money, so.  //  "

She also frames a lot of answers in terms of depending on your family's socioeconomic situation // QUOTES: Speaker 1:  So, can you tell me a little bit about College Access Now?    Speaker 2:  Yeah. Um, I think it's one of those, um, Americorps programs.    Speaker 1:  Okay.    Speaker 2:  Um, basically, my junior year in high school someone came into the classroom and was like, ""Oh, we help, like, first generation students, like, apply for college and all that stuff."" And I had no idea about the college application process, um, so I signed up for that. But junior year you don't really do anything. Like, you might, like, practice your essay writing or, like, you might start looking into school but obviously, when you're looking into school as a junior, those options probably weren't, like, serious options.    Speaker 1:  Sure.    Speaker 2:  Um, and then, senior year was when you really got, like, a lot of help from them. They, like, read over all your essays. They proof read them. They, like, pay for everything. You know, like, how it's a lot of money to, like, apply for college?    Speaker 1:  Yes.    Speaker 2:  All the applications, like, all the sending the SAT or the ACT scores. Um, they even provided, like, envelopes and stamps and, like, little things when you had to, like, send in your, like, letters of rec or something. Yeah. So, that was really helpful. // I was a part of this, but, like, during the summer they invite, like, a whole bunch of students to participate in something called, like, STEM or KEEP or something. And that's basically for first generation students. Um, so there's already, like, a group that's here before college and orientation actually starts and I think they get the, an advantage in that they get to, like, know each other. The thing that sucks about that though is, like, well, I wasn't a part of it, but, like, just kind of observing from afar. Like, if you're kind of, like, they were introduced to each other before school starts so they're friends with each other. But, then throughout the four years, I feel like they kind of just stick within themselves and I feel like that's kinda ... I don't know, like, I feel like they should branch out, you know? Like, you're already stuck with this friend group and they kind of never get out of it, which I feel like could be a disadvantage because then you're not really, like, mingling with people that are different from you. Um, in terms of, like ... I don't know. I feel like I never really seeked out, like, first generation students or anything just to, like, find something similar to myself because I never thought it was a problem that I was a first generation student. But I do think that's kind of just, like, me because, like, other people might not be comfortable, like, discussing, like, their economic background or, like, their first generation status to, like, people of, like, a higher status. But, like, I feel like I'm pretty, like, open about that stuff so it was never, like, something I had to, like, seek out to, like, find someone with similarities. // Speaker 2:  But, like, over the past, like, two years especially, like, I've asked for so many things and, like, I've gotten it all, so ... Yeah, that's another thing.    Speaker 1:  So, um, can you give me an example of the kind of things you're talking about?    Speaker 2:  Um, well, personally, I have, like, a lot of financial difficulties, and just, like, things like ... Like for graduation.    Speaker 1:  Mm-hmm (affirmative)    Speaker 2:  Um, I actually got, like, the ... One of the offices to buy plane tickets for my parents to come to graduation cause I wasn't sure we could afford that on my own.    Speaker 1:  Uhhuh (affirmative).    Speaker 2:  And if I couldn't, then, like, no one would come to graduation. So, I got the school to basically pay for the plan tickets for my parents to come. Um, they occasionally set up rides for me to go to and from the airport if I need, like, help getting around. This was also open to the entire school but, like, we have, like, this professional attire fund where, basically, if you landed, like, a job or interview they would, like, take you out on, like, a shopping spree basically. For business clothes. // Speaker 1:  Uhhuh (affirmative). Um, so, at the beginning I mentioned that we're talking to all of these different constituent groups. If we were to ask, um, parents to rank order these, these things, do you think that they would have the same ... The same relative ranking of things? Would getting a job, would that be most important, do you think, to parents? Or do you think they would pick something else as their number one?    Speaker 2:  Um, I think it depends on the background that your family comes from.    Speaker 1:  Sure.    Speaker 2:  Um, should I go more into it?    Speaker 1:  Yeah. Why not?    Speaker 2:  Okay. Well, for my family, personally, they definitely want me to get a job. Like, I think that's number one and it's far from the other three. Um, but, like, I know some of my friends are from, like, families that are, like, really well off and stuff and it's, like, realistically they don't even have to work, like, a day in their life.    Speaker 1:  (laughs)    Speaker 2:  And that's not, like, a bad thing. Like, I'm not like, ""Oh, you don't have to work."" But, like, I think it's a good thing. But, like, for them I think it's, like, college is just a way to, like gain different perspectives on people, knowledge, and the world and to learn to, like, live independently.    Speaker 1:  Mmmhmm (affirmative).    Speaker 2:  So I think, like, how you rank them depends on, like, what your family needs, I guess."

Their kid better come out and be able to make a decent salary afterwords. Like, it just like. It's an investment. And, obviously, like the board of trustees I think like, wants significant alumni donors and so I think people getting jobs.

They didn't try to go any farther with anything that they did. They were satisfied with what they had and then they got stuck. And I didn't want to be stuck in the same place. That's like my thing. I don't... I'm used to moving. I'm used to going where I want to go. Like where ever dad takes me, let's go. We're going. I want to be able to do that with my own life but not have to go through military. Because that's where both my parents met, in military.

Yeah, hockey team gets mopeds when they're not in season 'cause they don't want them to walk around and hurt their knees. They're getting mashed by people everyday. They're fine.

Especially people who grow up in low income families where they can't... They don't have the opportunity, then I think it's important for them to support their families in any way. So if it means getting a job as a mechanic or something that can do that. Then I say the priorities are in a different place, but on a whole, I think yes because I think in high school, it doesn't do a good enough job, and I don't think it should stop there. I think the extra four years is needed, and then people who go on beyond that, that's great too.

And we're not talking about a novelist, we're not talking about people who didn't go to high school or barely graduated and just became millionaires. We're talking about your average people, and it just prepares you to interact with the different social class. That's really all it does. I can go to Farmington, and there are people there that make like $10,000 a year and have nothing. But I can hang out with them and have a good time with them every bit as much as I can hang out with academic who spent their life in school, and has a good job and stuff like that.

If you're trying to get a job you're trying to make money, and that's the least important thing to me ever. And it's also because I have enough money to kinda do what I want now. I've positioned myself better than my family positioned their selves. I just... I made it so. Just study a particular area in depth. I mean part of undergrad is the broad experience. You're given a real good foundation in something in slight depth, but you don't really get to the depth of any subject matter until you get to grad school. ""To learn to live independently,"" that's a really good skill set and it has to do more with not being coddled. And the biggest thing is gaining your different perspective.

At the end when asked if there's anything else, she also brings up perceptions about higher education saying that some people assume she's wealthy because she's at Duke. I was on the border between low and medium here since finances don't seem to play much of a role in her campus experience, but went with medium because she brought up the stereotype issue independently. //      QUOTES: 21:51 S1: Right. Okay. So some people say that college should be a transformative experience, do you agree with that statement? Do you think there are certain ways that students should be transformed or shouldn't? What do you think about all of that?     22:08 S2: We were just talking about this in class today, the American Higher Education.    22:11 S1: Oh, yeah?     22:12 S2: But I think for... I think it should be transformative but to the extent of and how it's transformative, I am not really sure because it could be behavioral or it could be based on your, I guess, your attitude. And so if it changed your attitude but then you're gonna act out your behavior, I guess they'd wanna be, that's just transformative. But for the amount of money that you're putting into it and how much you're investing, I think people really, really expect it to be transformative because you're putting so much effort into it. So I think that it should be transformative but I don't know if that's based on your personal ideology or the academic side of your learning here, what the experience is and social events that you are able to be a part of. But I think it definitely does have a transformative effect and that's expected to.  //  29:57 S1: Awesome. So at the beginning of the interview, I was asking about your goals for your college experience, and now I'm going to ask you to put yourself in the role of those other constituencies that I've mentioned in trying to answer that question. So, for example, your parents, if I were to ask them what a student's goal should be for their college experience, what do you think they might say?     30:20 S2: Probably to get the academic background to be able to get a job that pays well and I'll be able to support myself with.  //  37:46 S1: We like hearing that. And finally, is there anything else you'd like to add that we haven't touched upon that you think is relevant to everything we've been covering so far?     38:00 S2: Well, I would say... Okay so, I have a perception of college, but then in the purpose I'm going, but then the general public has a perception of what college I go to and what things I'm studying and the purpose and the need for a college degree. So, I'd say that there's a disconnect between a students that actually gain a degree, and the assumptions that people that aren't with the university, the academics here make about you.    38:30 S1: So can you be a little bit more specific in what your perceptions versus what you see the public's perception is?     38:35 S2: Well, I see college as a chance to explore and I don't have a particular job or career path in mind at this point. But then, I tell someone, ""Oh I go to Duke."" They're like, ""Wow, you're gonna do this, this and this. You're going to get this type of job, you're gonna be well-paid,"" and all this stuff, and none of that's guaranteed, and that's not the purpose of going, whereas it seems a lot of people that personally telling you, that you go to a particular university is how it's gonna help your job chances and that's not the purpose of the university. And then also, I guess, each university or college has its different stereotypes and people sometimes are stuck on the stereotypes and can't see past that. So, I don't necessarily think that should be one of the things you introduce first because they might not get to know you fully very well.    39:24 S1: So, do you mean specifically when you meet other people in college or when people hear that you go to Duke?     39:29 S2: People outside of the community. So, if I'm at home and I'm going to a meeting with my parents, and then they introduce me to someone, and they go, ""Oh, my daughter goes to Duke,"" and then there's all sorts of weird things that are brought up that wouldn't be brought up if the college thing didn't come up first.    39:45 S1: Got it. Is there anything specific that comes up? Like what stereotypes?     39:51 S2: Well, okay, a lot of people talk about the drug culture at Duke, and because they're wealthy, it means that are a lot of students that are getting in trouble. I don't really know much about that, I don't really wanna talk about those things, to talk to other people about it.    40:04 S1: Right.    40:06 S2: And then, also, I guess just like the affluence of some of the students, people will come across and assume that you're wealthy and my family isn't from a wealthy background.

A lot of people from the Northeast, they get here and surround themselves with other people from the Northeast, who also went to prep school and also have the same views and the same people they always grew up with. So, I would guess, too dramatic here. But, I would say if there wasn't a Greek system I feel that would definitely allow more people to do things on their own rather than pay thousands of dollars for friends. So study abroad is big, Greek life kinda hinders stuff. This isn't really anything that can be fixed, but being in a city would obviously help.

It's a public high school technically but comes from a very wealthy area so it can fund...Outside of Chicago, it's the suburbs. So it had funding that rivaled a lot of private schools.// Well I mean, my parents are paying for school, and when I came home my dad's like, ""I'm not paying this crazy amount of money each year for you to only take drama classes,"" and I agree with him because the field of acting is not exactly the most stable one, and there's a family business that I will probably go into, and...That's real estate.// Administration is all about learning perspectives and living independently. And I think they know that if you got into Kenyon, if you could get into Kenyon, you can maintain, you can be academic and you obviously were able to be academic, unless you somehow sent them $400,000 or whatever. [chuckle] But I think, especially for myself, from orientation thing, 'cause they're all about making you learn different perspectives and learn independently and all that jazz.// And that's absolutely true. I mean, from the shows I've auditioned to, to just being... I came from, my hometown is all rich, white Jews. And because of that, I was never really exposed to anything that wasn't rich, white Jews. And coming to Kenyon has allowed me to be exposed to a whole slew of people who are not rich, white Jews. And that, alone, has really taught me that there is very much people, and I always knew it, but there's very much other people who're in different economic situations, who have different opinions on, because of X, Y, and Z. And I respect that. And that has allowed me to change some of my opinions as well. So, I think the most I've learned is about why people, and especially with all of the stuff with primaries, like why people would support Bernie. From at home, Bernie's considered some crazy guy, but when I talk to my peers here, I can understand why people would support him because they come from a completely different situation than I do.// And I think there's the two sides of the scale where Kenyon is forcing me to accept other people's opinions and let them affect me but also maintain my own opinions where... And it's crazy to look at our school. If I... I would probably be considered some sort of scum or whatever at Overland cause I'm a straight white male at the college and that's like... I'm supposed to be privileged and I'm supposed to feel bad about it and there's all that jazz that does not exist here, really. And I think that's nice, that you can be who you wanna be and no one's gonna judge you for it.    And you can... But because of that, you still have to be able to accept other people for what they are, and you have to let their values and let where they come from affect you and say, ""Hey like... "" of course, as I said, I knew coming in here that not everyone comes from a rich white Jewish neighborhood, but it is still a weird thing that like, ""Wow, you really do not have the same opportunities that I had.""// As I said, it's totally a melting pot here, even though people like to say it isn't, just socioeconomically it's pretty different from what I've seen, and maybe through another person's perspective that's absolutely not true, but from where I come from it's definitely a melting pot.

For me, I think it's important to have a degree, it's important to be able to have options and to be able to feel safe when you go into the workload.

Or I guess the assumption is that a lot of people don't worry about having degree and wanting to actually feel safe when they go and when they get into the real world. That was something that I definitely focused on when I was choosing my degree, and when I was declaring my major. But at the same time I don't think you should just do it, because you wanna feel safe. I think you should do it because you really do have the passion for it, and if there's nothing that you find enjoyable in the thing that you do, then you shouldn't do it. If the thing that you do doesn't necessarily give you safety financially or won't necessarily help you in the workforce, once you get out into the real world doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, because in the end whatever you do you gonna have to do for the rest of your life, so you might as well enjoy it, and fortunately I really do enjoy the work that I do in the Physics department, and at the same time, I appreciate that it's a degree that'll help me out once I do get into the real world.

And especially nowadays, where the job market is getting even more competitive and where just having a Bachelor's degree nowadays isn't good enough, and the stakes keep getting higher, I think having a degree in general, for somebody who, I guess, who does recognize the need for financial safety, it's important.   //  I definitely wanted to share my experience of being at a liberal arts college.

So the most important part of going to college is to get a job? Tell me about that.    19:08 S2: I think so. Well... Besides what I said about going to college to experience things and to learn about yourself, I think that in this economy, in this day and age, everyone knows it's more necessary to go to college to be able to get a job in the future. Even though to me the other more abstract things are important. Getting a job, kind of secures your future so you know that you can do the things you're interested in besides work... I don't know. For me, it's getting a job that I enjoy doing, but also just knowing that I'm financially stable so I can enjoy doing other things.  //36:17 S2: Okay. I think everyone should take some kind of...

That's what that they're learning for their clubs to do. It's actually very helpful when they get, when they're out of college and they're working, they have to start paying bills and all this stuff.

It has to be one, in that sense, that would offer a better education than any of those locally.    0:02:33 S1: Okay.    0:02:33 S2: But just because you are spending so much more money to go overseas, you do want to go to a school that in that sense, guarantees a quality education...

And then I applied to three schools in addition to the state schools, uh, that I knew I'd be comfortable to applying to financially.  //  Interviewee:	And, uh, Brandeis was because they had given me, uh ... It was not one of the schools that I had visited or intended on applying to.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

As far as um, and, and unfortunately, the uh, resources uh, given to students who are from less uh, less capable backgrounds uh, is sort of um, moved aside. It's this idea that at a higher education institution, you should be given the same opportunities as everyone else without sort of taking into consideration the nuances.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	And so, um, the, like for example, the fact that I not every written a paper before coming into Tufts and I've been taking social science classes.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	There's no resource for me other than or at least a resource that I had known about that was advertised to me.    Interviewer:	Yeah.

Here are ways we can go about doing this because where you come from a background where this is important.""  //  Interviewee:	Um ... A, a big problem is that uh, and this is entirely a resource-based question, which is very difficult to fix. Um, unless you know, the school does a lot better at fundraising.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, but certain departments that are more popular are not given funding as other departments.    Interviewer:	Oh, okay.

Interviewee:	Um, it's not one of the most popular majors. Uh, unfortunately, the number of faculty in the department had actually shrunk.    Interviewer:	Oh.    Interviewee:	Um, there is not enough resources. Because the department itself is under the school of engineering.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	It's a program that can be taken by both arts and science and major in both arts and sciences and engineering.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Uh, what that means is that the resources to the computer science department comes to the school of engineering rather than just the, the school of arts and sciences. The school of arts and sciences has more funding and the majority of the majors to computer science are in the school of arts and sciences. So this lack of funding is actually meant, and it's actually, it was also in uh, the department of computer science, not allowing anyone past their sophomore year or declaring major to take a computer science class.    Interviewer:	Wow. Wow, okay.    Interviewee:	Right. Because it's the only way they can allow resources to their current majors and people who might become majors. Um, and so if you ever declared a major and not computer science, you were not allowed to take it in your next class. You're shut out of it.    Interviewer:	That's fascinating.

Interviewee:	So uh, and I know people that before this was put in, declared computer science their junior year and then graduated as computer science majors.

Uh, and to get one just a job, but a career  Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, so that's why I thought to myself it'd be number one.

Um, at the end of the day, all we have is ourselves.  Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And it's important to know about how to go about being punctual and proactive and ambitious or whatnot in our independent endeavors. Um, cause that's gonna be the core foundation to why we even stay in college, go about passing our classes, and even going further than whatever careers and jobs we have.

Anything that's on your mind that you didn't get the chance to talk about that you feel is important for the college experience? Or anything at all?  Interviewee:	Um ... I guess, not off the top of my head, uh ... I feel as thought, uh, I think with my financial resources and all that stuff-  Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	But for that to be thoroughly communicated to help people out or what not, especially in a city that's so expensive (laughs)-  Interviewer:	Yeah.

I think they do a pretty great job-  Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, thus far. Um, yeah.

Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	(laughs)  Interviewer:	(laughs)  Interviewee:	Um, yeah. Like, they'll take away the scholarship and I can never apply again. Here comes the loan immediately, uh-  Interviewer:	Mmm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Check for whatever the case may be.  Interviewer:	Oh-  Interviewee:	Um, and it's the last dollar and just a whole bunch of weird technicalities that matter there [inaudible 00:57:26] for something that's supposed to be so great.

Do you have an advisor or someone to go to who could help you with that qualifications and making sure you're on top of it? Or is it up to you?  Interviewee:	Um, it's more so, I guess, up to me.

And also, I'm a part of Tufts Financial Group, so we invest on... We have a portfolio worth $100,000 and we're divided into sectors and we invest all that money based on stocks, or bonds, or real estate, so that's pretty awesome. Yep. And I'm also the Campus Manager for Tufts SnowJam. So in January, we're going to Mont-Tremblant in Montreal, to just have like a blast, ski for three days. // 04:58 S2: Educational program. So I know that I'm interested in Econ, and I know that Tufts, they don't have a business school. I can say like that's the con of Tufts. But also, the benefits of Tufts is that they still have finance classes such as Intro to Finance, or Financial Accounting, which I'm taking next semester. And in a way, I don't think you need a business school in undergraduate education because so many people take MBA after their undergraduate education. So I feel like for my undergraduate experience, I want to take as many classes as I can in a way that it covers so many scopes. For example, I can take English classes, I can take Cognitive and Brain Sciences. So that is what is truly amazing because at the year of 18 right now, I don't really know what I'm doing. So I really wanted to experience all those subjects, even though I know that I'm probably going to an MBA or Econ. But I still want to experience what it feels like to be in a liberal arts school. // 19:54 S2: For example, never in a million years would I think of writing a constitution for an a cappella group or having that experience, or maybe joining a workshop from Tufts financial group like making a financial model and studying that by myself in a 48 hours workshop. So, I feel like that is the kind of opportunities that you can't get just by taking online courses, because in a community like this, you're being put with 5,000 intellectual students that, and requires you to communicate to practice your communication skills. And for example, like this, Harvard study, it's worth the experience which you can't get if you just learn from an online course."
LAS1042,P167,School 8,Medium Importance,Seniors,"MEDIUM IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: He mentions the opportunity cost of college in general, noting that it’s difficult for lower income or middle class families to afford, and specifically mentions that financial aid may not carry over for study abroad. He says that he’s focused on being able to get a job out of college because he comes from a family background where he will need to support himself. //    QUOTES: Interviewer:	Right, okay. Interesting. So in general, do you think its important to go to college? And maybe why or why not?  Interviewee:	Um ... Just like anything else in life, there's an opportunity cost to do- go into college, so I think that opportunity cost has to make sense for you. Obviously, the financial ... one is probably the biggest. Especially in America when you're having to pay, like, five digits per semester to be in college. Um, I think that's, you know, its something that you just cannot underestimate, um, you know. I go to school where the average parent income is $270,000, or something stupid like that.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	So, um I think for a lot of students here, there wasn't too much of opportunity cost. Um, because obviously being in college, and in most industries ... um, in the current perspective, most industries having that, you know, bachelors undergraduate degree is imperative to actually even being considered for the job. So, um, I think it makes a lot of sense for people here, but maybe not at like other schools, um, where, um, you know- or, like, you know, other students who are just like, of lower income, you know, maybe like middle-class to the point that, like, they are making okay amount of money, but like, not enough to receive financial aid, and it- that's like a huge part of like income, I think that ... is when it starts to not make sense. Um, you know, for example, if you're interested in being in computer science, like me, you have to notice that am actual form of education isn't necessary, it's the fact that you are educated and you are young, skillful, and interested in what you're doing, that's all that matters. So-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	I think that if you're so sure about doing that, then maybe college is up for you. But obviously, there's also benefits of, you know, social maturity, intellectual maturity, and things like that. A lot of things that I don't think are quite quantitative through measurable. Um, and I don't think ... those are the things that you can acquire at other spaces, just because you don't live with so many like-minded, you know, like-minded, or differently-minded students. Um, you know, people your age at this time of like, you know, when ... you are so flexible, mentally.  //  	And I think finally is ... uh, there's a lot of students who wanna study abroad, and as someone who's studied aborad, I don't wanna say that like, it changed my life or anything like that, but it is definitely, uh, a part of my college experience that was, um, that was different and provided a totally different prospective for me. And um, there's a lot of students who aren't able to go because of, for example, financial aid doesn't carry it over, or, an engineering student, there's too many requirements. Um, there's to many requirements to, like afford to go abroad to a different institution. So, um, I think if they let- made it easier for students to study abroad, um, that would be ... very cool for the students.   //  Interviewer:	Mmm, okay. Um, so I actually have another rank order question for you, so ill send it again in the text box. These are four statements about why its important to go to college. So, again, just thinking from your own perspective, what the most important reason for you to be in college, and that would be number one, and then go down in order to four what would be the least important reason.   Interviewee:	For me, or people in general?  Interviewer:	For you.   Interviewee:	Okay. I'll just number them and then explain it I guess, uh, so, one is, ""to get a job."" Um ... two is to, ""gain different perspective on people."" Three is just ""to study a particular content area in depth,"" and four is, ""to learn how to live independently.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um ... ah, lets go ... um, yeah I think number four is easy, just because I've learned to live independently before, so that's like nothing new to me.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, I picked number one, ""to get a job,"" was the most important because, um, we can- you can definitely view college as some kind of financial transaction, and obviously, it's not the most- it's not- it'd definitely shouldn't be the only output of college, but you're putting in so much money, and if you're getting only, sort of, you know, qualitative, personal growth, kind of things out of college, I just don't think its worth it and you can't sustain yourself later, so. Especially coming from a family where I cannot support myself after college, getting a job is really important.   //  Interviewer:	Right, right. Okay, um, and I'm actually, I'm at my last two questions, so, what motivated you or interested you to participate in our interview today?  Interviewee:	Uh, financial reasons.  //  "

Plus also being able to live at home, my parents are very awesome and they let me live there for free, so I didn't have to pay ...    Interviewee:	Any additional [inaudible 00:15:09] cost, anything like that. So that would probably be a pro. My con would probably be I didn't have a lot of independence in the sense that, you know my parents were so worried about when I would come home at night and ...    Interviewee:	Also what I was doing all the time. So my independence was kind of restricted living at home, but I mean I gained a lot of other things living at home as well, so. // Interviewer:	So what motivated you or interested you to participate in the interview today?    Interviewee:	Um, one, gift card. So um and two, and I feel like it's helpful for people to get surveys about you know college students to be able to understand what works and what doesn't work. Um, like I said we always have surveys that come around like OSU, so I think it's really helpful to participate in them to see what staff or faculty can do better to make the college experience for students better. //"

11,P057,School 8,Low Importance,Seniors,"LOW IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: The student mentions that the tuition cost is a big problem at Tufts (in general) and that courses in personal finance would be a useful part of the curriculum but doesn’t mention anything about her own finances or bring it up regularly.    QUOTES: 09:53 S1: And now thinking about the curriculum of college. Let's say that hypothetically, you could become the Dean of Tufts, and you could design your own program for students to take while they're at the college for four years. What do you think that that program would look like? What kinds of knowledge or information do you feel are most important for students to be exposed to and to learn?     10:17 S2: Well, to be honest, I wouldn't really change the current model. I think that Tufts seeks... The College of Arts and Science seeks to be a liberal arts institution and I think that it accomplishes that goal because we've a lot of requirements as undergrads in terms of language, national science, mathematical sciences, we have to take humanities, art... All sorts of courses that we need to take in order to graduate. I think one of the main things that college grads need is the ability to write and to express yourself verbally and in a written sense.    11:04 S2: But I think I could just be biased because I am more of an art, writing, humanities person, but I think that that's really important skill to have. But I think that you need exposure to areas that aren't your strengths because you need to have that challenge. I've had to take... I'm not a math or science person, and I've had to take two math and two science courses, in my undergrad career, and it was horrible and I hated the experience because I really didn't like the material and I really struggled in the class and it was really frustrating to have to put so much time and energy in courses that I wasn't interested in the material. But I think you learn from those experiences and you learn from the challenges, and I think you then kind of by effect kind of gain more confidence in what you are skilled in.    11:58 S1: Okay.    11:58 S2: That's been kind of a weird, kind of a reverberating effect that I felt after taking those courses. I felt way more confident in the skills that I have, that I like to use and the materials that I like to work with.    12:15 S1: I haven't heard anybody explain it like that. But I can see exactly what you're saying.    12:19 S2: I think especially that happens in the Liberal Arts education, is that you're forced to take these courses that you don't want to take, but that I think you need to have the experience of it. If I really had the power to adjust the curriculum in any way, I would maybe create some sort of system where you could pick and choose where I would have rather taken three arts courses and three humanities courses and one math and one science. I think that you should be able to... I don't know why I necessarily had to pay to take two of each when I think I would have gotten more out of honing existing skills. I also think that there are certain courses that I've taken that have been so important for me that I think would be great if they were kind of like foundational courses that every undergrad had to take.    13:22 S1: What types of courses do you feel would be good, those good foundational courses?     13:27 S2: I took a class called Intro to American Politics in my freshman year, but it's still a class that I look back on and think ""Wow! That was one of the classes that I think I learned the most."" I think we just need to know, as good citizens, we need to know how our government works, and we need to know the structure of it, the history, the challenges it faces, how decisions are made, the bureaucracy. I think we need to know that stuff. I also think that Sociology courses are really important. I'm biased again, but I think that everyone should be taking on History courses.    14:07 S1: No. I want your bias. I want to hear what you think about these things. I don't want you to tell me what you think that other people might think. This is all about what you believe in.    14:17 S2: I think that Art History courses are really underrated. I think that they're really hard for people who... I have friends come to me all the time asking what's an easy Art History course I can take and I don't have an answer for them, because if you're not conditioned to be taking Art History courses, they're really difficult, because it's a totally new way of writing and of approaching any kind of academic field. It's all visual based and foremost condition to go off of text or kind of like go off of a thesis if you're more of a science person, going off of studies.    14:51 S2: But I think I wish that I had taken some sort of foundational like business, finance, kind of basic applied math courses. That's not really offered. And that would have served me so much better than kind of the fake math courses that I had to take in order to get my degree, and fulfill the distribution requirements. I wish that I had taken Econ, but the Introduction to Econ classes were really intimidating to me. Yeah, I don't know, I think that there are certain knowledge bases that we should be pushed to develop, but in place we're kind of pushed towards these silly science courses and silly math courses if you're more of a Humanities person, which is unfortunate.    15:43 S1: I've heard that too, like it should be more interesting and something that's more applicable to everybody.    15:50 S2: Yeah, I mean, like Balancing Your Checkbook 101 would be a great course that's just not offered, but I think that those are things that we need to learn. I mean, I still meet friends who don't know how to balance a checkbook, and I'm lucky that my parents taught me to do that. But those kinds of personal finance and kind of what is investment, what does that mean and all that kind of stuff. My parents have taught me that kind of stuff, but that's not what everybody knows and I think it's important. Well, they may not be applicable now. Once we have jobs, and have an income, those skills are gonna be so vital.    16:24 S1: And yeah, what you decide to invest in and where you decide to put your money. I mean, that does eventually trickle down and influence a lot of other things, so.    16:34 S2: Exactly.  //  "

Now I have to go find something that's gonna make me money when I graduate,"" if you didn't feel kind of in this chokehold of, you know, in some sense, I've... It makes sense that I'm here and I've earned being here and I've worked hard to get here and I worked hard while I'm here, but that isn't necessarily enough for it to be just like a free choice to me.

They would say, to build that community into, become a part of it, because they clearly still feel like they're part of that community and they give back. I think to have the best college... Like a college experience that's worth what you're putting into it. So, that's worth your money really. So to have, to go to a place where you feel like you're the getting the most from your teachers, from the environment and stuff like that. And then also maybe something about getting a well-rounded education if they're a Tufts trustee. Just to have a world sense, that you wouldn't, if you just got out of school and did the job in one thing.  //  50:05 S1: Do you think that students who graduate from here are somehow different or lead different lives from student who graduate other colleges?     50:14 S2: I think everybody leads a different life [laughter] than everybody else. Your college shapes you in a certain way. I wouldn't deny that. I have a friend who goes to Northwestern and the way that she is approaching graduating is different because, according to her, there is this pressure that exists there and is communicated to her through her fellow students in the student body of, ""You need to be making a lot of money,"" and things like that.

This was on the border between low and medium, but we chose medium because although finances don't impact her day-to-day experience, it seems like it is a pervasive concern covering the overall experience.

And I think ethically, they kind of leave it open for you, but we're such a liberal campus that I think even here, people are very sensitive about what they're saying. What they think is right and wrong. I think the most helpful thing that I've had this year was I went to a social justice day last week as part of ATL. Like I was a representative of ATL Massachusetts.    36:25 S2: And they kind of outlined the aspects and... Issues behind social diversity and social justice issues. I would say that I think on this campus though can sometimes be skewed because most people are coming from a very privileged background and you... Most of the people don't think about... Like the people might not be able to afford things or the ethics of posting, or asking people to pay things that they haven't bought, simple things like that.  //  46:15 S1: When you see or talk to friends who either didn't go to college or maybe even just went to a different college, in what ways do you notice a difference between how their experiences have changed them and how your experiences at Tufts have made a difference for you? Are there any distinctions?     46:33 S2: Yeah. A lot of my, a majority of my friends went to Big 10 schools so like University of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin. And they go out like every night of the week. So a majority, they rushed fresh... Their Fall semester, and so, they're very involved with like fraternity and sorority life, and that is their social circle, which I think is restricting. And also it's weird to me that in a community of like 40,000 people that you choose, in your first two weeks, that you're gonna hang around these 20, or 20 girls or whatever.    47:17 S1: For the rest of your four years, yeah.    47:19 S2: Yeah and, but it's... I mean their experiences have been like a lot of social experiences versus academic, I would say, and they're drinking Monday through to Saturday and then they take their breaks. Like they day drink Saturday and then take a break and sleep on Sunday kind of thing, and I'm so glad I don't have that pressure 'cause I think people here really respect academics and work versus just being in an environment where you have pressure from other people to go out and drink and especially, I think in particularly sorority life.    47:55 S2: And then other friends of mine that are commuting to community college. Like this specific friend of mine, he is working two jobs to try to pay to go to a university eventually, and I know that he's just had... This is a very negative experience 'cause you're... I think at least at those community colleges that you're surrounded by, I don't know, single mothers that are trying to be more hirable or fathers of... They're like 12-year-old dads trying to learn some sort of technical skill and people that are very unmotivated. So to be surrounded by people with that sort of mentality is difficult, I think even to learn and...

Um, that's [inaudible 00:19:08].// Um, well, one this is again really specific, but like, um, one thing that I'm actually writing a policy about for, um, the Roosevelt Institute is that how DePaul um, has this policy that if the student enters the residential halls, um, and basically appears intoxicated, the DR, which is the person who swipes people in, um, calls a private ambulance and has them sent off in an ambulance.    And, at first that sounds, you know, like something that might be helpful to people who have alcohol poisoning, et cetera, but as we know, that's typically not the case. And um, it's, it targets uh, students at a lower socioeconomic status because, you know, if- if they're just students whose parents have a lot of money, it's just a slap on the wrist to get a thousand dollar ambulance, which they do threaten us, they say a thousand dollars, and they could use a public ambulance but they don't. And um, you know, for someone who's paying out of pocket, that's a really big punishment and a really big deal for them. And could even mean costing the rest of the quarter.

Now let’s say if it wasn’t for that, if it wasn’t for that financial incentive, would there have been anything distinctive about the educational program at UNH that would have attracted you or was it really just that push?    Interviewee:	It was partially that but I’m a double major political science and philosophy but I really wanted to be in New Hampshire during the 2012 election cycle and students of UNH get really unprecedented access to candidates coming through during that so I would say it was partly financial reasons but also the election cycle and having access to the candidates.  //  Interviewer:	And do you think that in general it’s important to go to college?

But I think – I’ve been pretty fortunate in that I work when I need to but I don’t need to work to put my way through school.   And it’s sort of been a Petri dish for social attractions, artistic passions, academic passions.  And I think a big part of that growth has come from taking risky decisions and knowing that if it goes wrong that it’s not the end of the world because I’m not out in the real world yet.  That being said I’ve certainly made some decisions that I regret but I think having the chance to regret is ultimately valuable.  //  Interviewer:	So this next one’s probably going to be similar type of answer but the board of trustees.  What do you think they would say their goals are for students or what they hope students get out of a college experience?    Interviewee:	I mean I could Google their mission statement, because they like their mission statements.  I would say at least in the case of New Hampshire it would probably be affordability.

Interviewee:	Um, what you would call it. Oh, oo what was it? Oh crap, what was it? Oh, man. Right, I knew this before because I've taken college now from my high school. And since QC is right here it introduced me to college classes. And so, I first, the first class every college now student has to take is English 110 or whatever it is, like the first English class. So, I knew just from taking that class like, oh this is gonna be great. Like, I can't wait, this is an actual college class, gonna be so cool.

Interviewer:	No problem, and uh, do you think it's, in general, important to go to college? Why or why not?    Interviewee:	Oh, man. Definitely. I definitely think it's really, um, super important to go to college because of how, when you actually go to college you get to experience new things, a lot of new things for the first time in which you're able to kind of adjust to it earlier on rather than just going outside with like, not having that experience for the first time and just totally being thrown out of the curve like, oh crap I don't know what to do. And then plus, when you have a, that college experience, you know, you mature in a way. So, it's kind of like that transitional gap from pretty much, what would you call it? Young adulthood to like, mid adulthood. I don't know what to say. You know, it's just, it's pretty good. You just need that because it helps you mature in many different ways. And it helps you to get a better job and secure a better financial status, I suppose in the future as well. // Yes, I definitely haven't mentioned a few. Um, I'll start off with cons. When it comes to commuting you have to pay, like money to get here. And so, that 275 is gonna get on your behind like really quick, you thought it was nothing before, but wait after until like a week and you're like, oh my god I already spent like, a lot of money, it's like, and it's only been a week. It's crazy. Um, and then with also commuting again, figuring out how long it's gonna take you to get here to college. Like, you kind of have, in a way, to just hope for the best and hope there's not traffic. You just have to rush to kind of do a lot of things. Or it could be the opposite for someone. Maybe they'll be able to use google maps or be able to use transit apps, whatever they can to say okay, this is when the bus or train usually comes. Like, I have to get the exact same time. I have to leave the house at this exact same time. So they're able to make a schedule for themselves, which is grea.t I think it, it's just, it's different. So there's many pros and cons to it. // Interviewee:	[inaudible 00:23:58] like that. It, it, see, it's really hard for me now because a new, in a way, it's a new environment. You know, it's not, but as a full time student now, it's different. It gives me more of like an obligation to really focus on your studies and do well academic wise.    	Try not to procrastinate. Um, but when it comes to forming friendships, that's definitely not my number one priority because that would be foolish. I didn't come to college and I'm not paying for college to make friends like that, no. Um, but yeah, I think it's just getting, escaping that mentality that I don't have to have any friends like especially in college. Like new friends, I mean. I have my old friends. // Interviewee:	Yeah, okay so it's like, definitely the $50 metro card because I needed that for college especially, like I said earlier, that $275, it may seem like nothing in the beginning, but honestly, even after a week, you'd be like, ""Oh, shoot, I lost a lot of money."" So I definitely um, wanted that and I was aiming to get that hopefully, um just to get a $50 metro card it would be able to save me a lot of money, my mom a lot of money. Instead of having to repay or refill my card like every morning 'cause it's crazy.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Yeah, I want to save that money, which is great.

So, I got involved in organizations and I got a work-study position. That helped me manage my time a lot better because I had other priorities. // Interviewer:	Tell me a little bit about your role as an academic mentor. When students come to you and they've been found to be plagiarizing, how do you help them? How do you have a conversation with them?  Interviewee:	So, the first thing I would do is remind the students that I am a professional staff and I am bound to report these things, but we really work on the students' skill sets and concentrate on the fact that they don't need to resort to plagiarizing or cheating to do well. Usually, when we concentrate on how to improve the reading skills, how to improve test taking and things like that, the students stray away from the easy way out, especially when they realize the serious repercussions of being caught plagiarizing or cheating. They realize that's not worth spending $30,000 a year and then being kicked out because you're plagiarizing. So, being explicit about those things really helped with that.   Interviewer:	Is that something that would happen? If somebody was caught plagiarizing, would they actually be kicked out of the school?  Interviewee:	Yeah, I think there's a couple of different levels in terms of how serious it is, and the extent that they were plagiarizing or cheating. I haven't had an experience with a student where they ended up being kicked out, but it is something that we always warn students of. It's a scare tactic.   Interviewer:	You said a scare tactic?  Interviewee:	Yes. It usually works. // Interviewer:	What about risk-taking? Is it important to take risks while you're in college?  Interviewee:	I think so. There's obviously limitations to that, but for me, I took a lot of risks that weren't necessarily positive my first year, and they were all extremely good learning experiences. I think it's important that if you do take risks and it goes poorly, that you learn from them because I think that's one of the things that motivated me the most to get the most out of my education and to be so involved.   Interviewer:	Is there an example of one of those risks that you'd be willing to share, or is that personal?  Interviewee:	Oh, no absolutely. I actually share with my students all the time to scare them mostly. I was actually on probation from being busted at an underage party. Because I was on probation for a year, I had one of my scholarships taken away for that year and I couldn't study abroad. So, that really affected how I was expecting my schedule to turn out in terms of when I can do what. So from that experience, I learned to be a lot more careful. I learned that doing things really does affect different facets of your life. So, that was definitely – even if I could turn back time and change things, I don't think I would change that necessarily because it really taught me a lot about being responsible. // Interviewer:	Are you planning to continue onto a Master's program?

Uh, I got into Irvine and Riverside and I didn't get into the other two, but ultimately even though people considered UC to be the better option, I chose CSUN because Irvine and Riverside were really far and I had a fee labor when I applied which is why I wasn't really thinking through of what to apply for.    But, um, so that's why, um, when I got the fee labor, I was able to apply to 4 UC's for free without paying for the fee, which is why I also applied at those two as well, even though it as far.  And then, once I got the acceptance letters from those two, I kind of figured that CSUN was the closest and since I work to support my family and just buy their groceries and all that, I figured it'd be better for me to stay here because then I could just stay at home and commute from home to CSUN instead of moving all the way the Irvine or Riverside. //[Great.

Actually first, from your perspective, what do you think are the biggest challenges on this college campus?     27:19 S2: Challenges, in terms of anything?     27:22 S1: Problems, challenges, issues that you see that could be better, could be different?     27:30 S2: I don't know that it could be different or better or anything. But the fact that East and West campus are separated...    27:37 S1: I'm learning.    27:40 S2: And there's... The bus system is great. It runs pretty regularly, except weekends is a bit less. I can make it to all of my classes on time, even the quicker transitions. The only difficult one I have is a 25-minute from one on East to one way on the far side of West. But there's a bus that runs right along that route. That comes right as my first class lets out.    28:23 S1: So they sync'd that pretty well?     28:25 S2: Yeah.    28:25 S1: Okay.    28:27 S2: And just because they know that's a popular time that classes get out, and people need to get over to that part of the campus, Science Drive. It works. It's just that added thing you have to worry about. The freshman meal plan is not very good.    28:55 S1: What's not good about it?     28:59 S2: Since all the freshman live on East... I don't know the exact reason, but then again I think they want you to get most of your food at the Marketplace.    29:09 S1: Oh, okay.    29:13 S2: The food plan for freshman is based mostly on swipes. So like when you swipe in the Marketplace, it's an all-you-can-eat. You get, I think it's five. So you get five breakfast swipes a week and then seven that can be either dinner or brunch. So weekends, they don't do breakfast/lunch, they just do a brunch and then a dinner. One of the biggest problems with that, is that's not enough to get three meals a day.    29:55 S1: Right.    29:57 S2: It's not... The way it's set up, you have to skip two meals. You have to skip either two dinners or brunches a week, because you have seven dinner or brunch.    30:15 S1: Okay. So what do you do then?     30:18 S2: Usually, there are opportunities to eat at other places, like if there's some activity going on or with marching band, we get cards with money preloaded on it for every game, so we can get food there. Otherwise, some people cook stuff in their dorm.    30:40 S1: Oh, okay. And is there no option to add on, so that you have like a...    30:46 S2: You also have food points, which is just money, but that with the bigger plan, it breaks down to about $4 a day, you pretty much use it to buy lunch primarily, but $4 is nothing.    31:12 S2: Interesting.    31:13 S1: And you can add onto that, but then the other... The things that don't really make sense, so if I don't eat breakfast one morning, I can get a $4 credit towards lunch, but only at Marketplace or at one certain place on West, before noon. So Marketplace, it's anytime, lunch; the other place, it's before noon, but it's only $4 that you get, which doesn't really buy you anything. And especially considering if you're a guest at Marketplace, for breakfast or dinner, it costs $16.50 and the fact that if you don't use that you only get $4, is a bit ridiculous. The fact that skipping a breakfast... So breakfast and dinner are both $16.50, so if I don't use the breakfast swipe or the $4 equivalency that day, it's gone.    32:21 S1: Oh, how interesting.    32:22 S2: Yeah. So it's not if I skip a breakfast one day that can be towards the weekend one. It has to be dinners.    32:34 S1: Interesting.    32:35 S2: Yeah. And then dinner, if you miss dinner, there's a cafe outside the Marketplace. You can get an $8 credit instead of using your meal swipe after 9 o'clock, but then if you don't use all your swipes in a week, they don't roll over, you just lose them.    33:01 S1: Do you keep track of what your swipes are? Is there a way for you to monitor that or you?     33:10 S2: When you swipe, it tells you what your balance is.    33:14 S1: Oh, okay.    33:16 S2: So, it'll say breakfast balance, I think, how many you have left for the week and then dinner/brunch.    33:25 S1: Interesting.    33:28 S2: It's frustrating, and especially with breakfast, if you don't use it one day, it's gone and with the other ones, if you have a leftover, it's gone, too. And especially, I don't know if you're technically paying for it, because they factor into the price that people are gonna miss meals, but it seems like, if you don't use all of them, you should be able to roll it over.

To get a job was number one most important. Number two was to gain different perspectives. Number three is to study a particular content area in depth and number four is to live independently.    Interviewer:	And why do you see them fitting into that order?    Interviewee:	Um, I feel like most people, uh, feel [inaudible 00:50:30] to get a job. Like, it's because you need a specialized degree. Like if you're going into a math or a science, you need a math or science degree really to get a job. Um, college is kind of almost [inaudible 00:50:43] into a requirement to get a job now. You almost, you need a bachelor's degree pretty much to get a job anywhere. Um, and so I see that as being the main reason. Unless you're going somewhere vocational.    	Um, to gain different perspectives, I feel like that's just such an important part of being in college is interacting with people and gaining those different perspectives. But even though it might not be the reason most people, like, make the mental decision to go to college, I think it's just such an important, like, byproduct of it. That- that's why- why it's important to go there.    	And then third is to study a particular content area in depth. Um, I'd assume that would mostly go along with getting a job, but outside of that, I actually don't see a lot of just for, going to college just for that purpose, unless you can ... Well, I'm also a little biased because I come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money to throw around, so I wouldn't see just going to college for fun, study stuff as, like, a reasonable thing to do. But for people, I guess, who have a lot of money and would be willing just to go to college just to study anthropology for fun, I could see them doing that. Otherwise, it just doesn't seem like it'd be reasonable to me.  //Um, I think they probably would. Let me look at it again. Um ... I still feel like to get a job would be the highest priority because parents are usually the ones who are spending the most money on their kids going to school, um, until they're usually putting their kids through school so that, like, they can function in the world and get a job and stuff. So I think that'd be the number one priority. Um, but I think the idea of gaining perspectives and stuff would kinda be lower on the list 'cause they're like, [inaudible 00:55:04] parents are like, ""You know, we're paying for you to get your education.

So yeah, I think that's why. The function of college is to gather people together and- like I don't think later on in life whether you're working or stuff, your circle gets smaller and its not as easy to start a conversation about really random things. The second to get a job because practically speaking that's what people are here for and that's one of the practical benefits of college.

I think as an undergraduate, its not as important to go in depth as to go as broad, because you're also like again, you're gonna get access to so many fields, might as well try them all out. I think grad school, for me, and you company is when your tying to it. They're really so different right now, its broader complex study you can tie into that deep area 'cause there's no use.

Interviewee:	Well, actually it was financial reasons.  If it was up to me, I would have gone to the Columbia College in Chicago.  But with that said, I think the money just wasn’t working, and New Hampshire, although I think we’re like the second most expensive in-state tuition school in the country, they give out fairly good financial aid.  And both my sisters went here too, and so since they were in college, I got better financial aid, because they were in there the same time as me.      Interviewer:	So they both came here too?    Interviewee:	Yeah.      Interviewer:	Was there anything about the educational curriculum or the way the school was – was there anything else other than just financials that made you choose UNH over anything else, or was it just like, this is the right dollar amount?    Interviewee:	Yeah, that was pretty much the dollar amount.  Because I didn’t even visit UNH before I came here.  I didn’t tour it or anything.  I came up to move my sisters a couple times, so I was fairly familiar with it, but as far as – I didn’t really choose it for its curriculum or anything like that.  I was dead set on getting out of New Hampshire, actually.  But it worked out for the best.  // Interviewer:	Do you believe – what do you believe?  Is it important to go to college or not?  Do you think that that should be a goal for everybody, or do you think it’s not necessary?    Interviewee:	I think it’s definitely a case-to-case basis.  I think it depends on what you want to do, and how you want to go about doing it.  Especially these days, because college is such a financial burden when you get out of college.  It definitely – although it helps you in getting a degree and getting interviews, and taking a step towards what you want to do, it also hinders you, because you have so much debt that sometimes you can’t move to where you want to go, and be where you would need to be to get that extra step on other people.  Which I’ve definitely seen with my sisters, and hopefully won’t see with myself.      But I definitely think it’s a case-to-case basis, because my mom didn’t go to college, and she’s in sales now, and she’s doing pretty well.  My dad only went to three years of college, and he’s doing pretty well.  I almost dropped out of college, but –    Interviewer:	Really?      Interviewee:	Yeah.      Interviewer:	How did that happen?    Interviewee:	It was – let’s see it was sophomore -- yeah it was the end of sophomore year, going into junior year, I looked up my total bill of debt accrued so far, and it was like at $20,000.00.  I was like, “Mom, this is crazy, by the time I get out that’s going to double to about $35,000.00 to $40,000.  How am I ever going to pay that off?”      And so I just kind of had a major freak-out, and I decided that I was just going to – I was going to leave school for at least a year, and move to a city, start auditioning for things, and see if I could get a job, because dance and theater are definitely not things that you necessarily need a degree for, if you don’t want to ultimately get a terminal degree and become a professor, or something like that.      And then like three weeks after all the deadlines passed for financial aid and housing, and everything like that, I was like, “Ah, I should stay in school,” especially because I definitely needed more training at that point, in order to do what I wanted to do.  So I think, in that sense, it’s kind of a catch-22 for most people, because they need the degree to have the knowledge to get the career, but at the same time, they’re essentially mortgaging a house, almost, to do what they want to do. // Interviewer:	In general, what’s your view on online learning?      Interviewee:	I think that’s the way the education seems to be going right now, just because it’s a lot cheaper to not have a room full of 200 people, and you don’t have to necessarily heat it, and stuff like that.  But I think it’s going to be a whole new challenge on learning, I guess.  Just because I feel like learning should be not necessarily just educational, but social.  You bounce ideas off of other people, and they bounce ideas off of you, and that’s kind of like what’s spurs the expanding mind, if you will.  Whereas, if you’re just sitting in a room like this, on a computer, by yourself, watching a lecture, that doesn’t necessarily – you don’t have the other people around you to challenge you with other aspects of what the professor might be saying.      Interviewer:	What would you say to parents who argue that their kids can get a sufficient undergraduate education online?      Interviewee:	I wouldn’t disagree with that.  I know there are a lot of classes – actually I’ve been reading about that a lot lately.  I think through MIT and other Ivy League schools, sometimes they offer open-source classes online for totally free.  And so I’ve heard a lot of people trying to take those.  But the problem with those is their completion rate is only like 5 or 10%, or something like that.  So if you don’t have a financial risk, you don’t necessarily have motivation to complete the course.  But with the other online schools or classes that I’ve heard about, like University of Phoenix, and stuff like that, I don’t necessarily think their credibility right now is where it should be, compared to an actual physical university.

So, I stayed with her and I just felt really comfortable here.    0:01:47 S1: Great.    0:01:49 S2: So, that's pretty much it.  "" // ""Were there any other schools that were sort of at the top of your list that, maybe if more funding had come through, that you would have considered just as highly, or were you really, sort of won over by the visit and stay with your friend?     0:02:10 S2: Well, I really... I got into BC, and I really wanted to go to BC, but I couldn't afford it.    0:02:17 S1: Yeah, it's pricey school for sure.    0:02:20 S2: Yeah, and no merit money at all.  0:02:22 S1: Oh, my goodness. So, BC and UNH are very, very different in terms of size. Was that a consideration when you were thinking about UNH? Were you concerned that it might be too big, or that BC might be too small?     0:02:39 S2: Well, I kind of was open to anything 'cause I didn't really know what I wanted, but I did like the size of UNH. I think it's pretty big, but it's also smaller than some of the other states because like UMass is 17,000, I think. So, that was my other top choice just for money reasons, but I liked the size of UNH.    ""  // "" I'd probably go to the gym. The only thing about the gym, though, is it's way too small, the workout area. Every time you go, it's a fight for a machine if you're going at a remotely normal hour.    0:17:50 S1: Oh, that's interesting. I haven't heard that before.    0:17:53 S2: Yeah, it's very small. It's probably the size I would expect for a sports team locker room.    0:18:02 S1: Wow.    0:18:02 S2: Just 'cause other schools that I've been to of a similar size, sometimes they even have two gyms...    0:18:11 S1: Yeah.    0:18:11 S2: And they'll have... Our gym size, I would say, is probably a third of one of their gyms. It kind of stinks, I think, to pay that much for the school and to have that facility be so poor.  "" // ""So, to get a job. This one was hard, I think, 'cause you can get a job without a college degree, but I think nowadays it's becoming, basically, the new high school diploma to have a bachelor's degree. It's crazy. It's almost like an undershirt; as long as people know you have one, they don't need to see it, they don't really care what it is, but as long as you have one on. It's crazy, I think, and it's... I think that if you want a job in something that's gonna make you a lot of money, it's pretty much a prereq to have a bachelor's degree. And it is definitely possible to do it without one and I know a lot of people who've been successful that way; I just think it's a lot harder; you have to really shine. It just makes it easier to get a job that you wanna do.""    // ""Okay. Let's see. So, if you were, I guess this is another hypothetical, if you were the dean of the college, and you could start from scratch to design your own program for students to take while they're at UNH for four years, what would that program look like?     0:33:10 S2: That's hard. Well, I think... One thing that I always struggle with, I think, in terms of how I really feel about them is Gen Eds, because I personally felt that there were some Gen Eds that were a complete waste of my time and money, and that was really frustrating for me. But at the same time, I knew what I wanted to do.

"" Not easy at all, but it would be possible, very possible. And so, when it first occurred to me, I was like, ""That would be kind of cool. It would be hard, but it would be cool."" and then I talked to my parents and they were like, ""Well, do what you want to do, but obviously, financially, this is a good idea."" And then, since I'm doing the 5th year program, I can get bachelor's and master's in four years that way, so it's like my grad school is technically like under... It's not undergrad, but it fits into that timeline.    0:39:21 S1: Yeah.    0:39:21 S2: So it's pretty nice money-wise, especially since the fifth year program... The fifth year is the most expensive, so...    0:39:29 S1: Oh really?     0:39:30 S2: Yeah.    0:39:31 S1: Okay.

It seems really simple, too. It doesn't really sink in, and I don't think how much you're paying per class.

Having those good players there, you feel like they're gonna be people that will go to the NBA and succeed, and having a good team, and having the success that we have, always just brings out the huge community of fans. And we are all united for a sole, common purpose across financial, cultural, just socio-economic lines. Everybody loves who you are, for the most part, likes Duke basketball, or loves Duke basketball. You might get a few, one or two, UNC supporters that somehow get in, but, for the most part, everybody is just... They're crazy, they're camera-crazy. So yeah.  //  22:48 S2: Another problem would be... I guess the readiness of... I don't know how to verbalize it, but I feel that a lot of people look at Duke as an ivory tower. And they don't... They see, ""Oh, they have the basketball and the academics and everything,"" and a lot of times, Duke's name is tarnished through scandals. Off the top of my head, there's just a couple of scandals that recently... The chief basketball player being dismissed, and then they always... Then the noose that they found on campus and those scandals. It just seems like every day, it's something... It seems like the media or, I don't know who it is, try to find different ways to bring down Duke. Not only... There are stories, but... That's not something that I like, but yeah there have... Things have to be done about both those issues. Those are legitimate concerns people have.    24:11 S2: Last week, I think there is... One of my... I think Duke is a very diverse place, and it always, despite what people might think, there's always been a widespread amount of, different amount of cultures, differing opinions, and an abundance of diversity. But I still think that there might be a long way to go. I think it'd be good to have a little more infusion of cultures, different cultures. A little more diversity in... Socio-economic diversity, more specifically. Economic diversity, because I still think that there's diversity within a certain class of students. Not just students, but people, students' families. You can get people that make a certain amount of money and find people, pick and choose people, from different cultures, but they all have a certain level of economic status. I like what Stanford's doing with paying all the tuition for people that make $100,000 or less that could go a long way in introducing more economic diversity. There is a lot of people that make a lot of money. A lot of people, or a good amount of people make... There are those families that come from families that don't make a lot of money. There's a lack of people, they don't... And, I think that would help.    26:10 S1: You mentioned that, and you mentioned Arizona State. It seems like you are tuned in to higher-ed issues or news that's going on in the higher-ed world. How do you stay informed about issues like that 'cause it's not common that people are actually aware of all these things that are going on when they're still students.    26:29 S2: Well, I consider myself... I think that news and current events are very important. I feel like a lot of people at Duke stay in... I guess, connected, right? One of the first things I do whenever I go, before I start doing work or anything, is just take a little time to go on CNN or BBC or something, and to read one or two articles, because while I am a student with a focus on going into medicine, I'm also a citizen of this world, and I feel like knowing things outside of medicine, outside of what I am studying is important, being alert of what's happening in the world because I don't want something crazy to be happening and I had no idea about it, or, I don't want some injustice to happen. I wanna have a say, if anything, if something that I feel strongly about, happens. Education is something that, I think, is really important. Education, specifically, equality, as far as opportunity and education is important. Me coming from an immigrant background and from a lower socioeconomic class or level makes me more sensitive to issues of education and opportunity.  //  29:42 S1: All right. So, thinking back to a couple of days ago, before you were a Duke graduate, when you were still a student, if you imagined you had a free week on campus with no obligations, but all of the resources of the university were open and available to you, how do you think you would spend that time?     30:00 S2: A free week?     30:00 S1: Mm-hmm.    30:02 S2: I'm the type of person that wants to just learn and to gain skills. I think I would probably... Either I'm always trying, even though I'm trying to get into medicine, I'm always... I wanna... I'm really interested in business and in things like that. I'd probably spend... I just started investing in the stock market. I'd probably spend my time trying to figure out how or, I think I'd probably spend my time... If there's no obligations, no studying or anything?     30:33 S1: Nothing, no.    30:34 S2: I'd probably spend my time coming up with a business plan for something and trying to implement it or doing research on certain stocks that I wanna invest in. Or picking up a skill. I've always wanted to play the guitar, so maybe I'd take that week to try to start learning to play the guitar. But it's, I think it's always good to give yourself... That would have been awesome to have a week to dedicate to stuff that I just truly want to do.  //  44:48 S2: Oh, don't believe what any of the media says about Duke. Duke is a diverse place. It's the first place where diverse people and diverse ideas come together. And the fact that a sexual assault occurred here, and sexual assaults occurred here, that's a problem but it's not, I don't think... It's not as widespread as people think it is. I think that Duke gets a bad rap from what happened with the Lacrosse case.    45:17 S1: Sure.    45:20 S1: I think that, which is last thing I was going to say... Oh, and with the case with noose has proven to be this... Like, this Indian kid who didn't know what noose meant, and while there is a lot of open dialogue here because of these issues, I feel like a lot of people from the outside might have a perspective that Duke is this Southern school, that people that are coming from minority cultures: Hispanic, African-American, any minority culture, Asian, they can't come and form their own experiences or have a strong Duke experience, it's not possible. It is possible, it happens every day, every year. I think people perceive Duke as this elite school. It's really not... I mean, I'm here. I'm at Duke and I'm a frigging immigrant. And I know a lot of people that went through Duke that come from very different backgrounds, but a lot of low socio-economic backgrounds that succeed and made Duke a platform to move on to bigger and better things. So, my message to transmit to you would be, Duke is not this terrible place where people are just attacking other people and being terrible people to each other, or, there's not this wild, rampant problem with sexual assault, it's stuff that happens, but happens in a lot of places. And Duke, for the most part, actually is a very, very diverse place, very loving, polite community and a very worthwhile, world-class institution.  //  "

It's like I'm fluent, I can use it in a job. That's all that's gonna matter, in the future. But I guess for people that... For other majors it makes sense to have the full specialization to just have on paper, and also just depending if you're gonna continue on in that field. You wanna have the full undergraduate course, okay, not just to say like you took a couple classes in the field.

I definitely have enjoyed it and I'm glad I have the means to be able to go, but it feels like a... Parts of it just seem like a waste of time. Sometimes, I just can't... Why am I here and why it's so expensive?

It's pretty exclusionary in a lot of ways and not very accessible for particular communities, people with particular identities so... And I see pluses and minuses.

Interviewee:  Plus, it ended up being cheaper than all the other options. // Interviewer:  Oh, I said, do you think it's important to go to college in general?    Interviewee:  I think in today's world there is a perception that every single person needs to go to college to get a career, and I really wish it wasn't that way because it's expen- prohibitively expensive, in some cases. Um, and also there are some jobs that I feel are very important that do not require a formal four year bachelor's program, such as going to trade school, becoming an electrician or a plumber, or becoming a technical welder. All of them are jobs that do not require traditional education in a college sense, but are very important and pay well. // Interviewer:  Okay. What do you think are the benefits of living on or near the college campus?    Interviewee:  The commute is a lot easier, I don't have to wake up quite as early as I would if I lived 15 or 20 minutes drive away. Um, I don't have to worry about parking, because I'm able to bike and that is saving me a couple hundred every month because it's so expensive here. // Interviewee:  Okay. Um ... hmm. This is tough, these are all very important reasons. I think number four would probably be learning to live independently, because I think you can, I think you can develop those resources, um, in other ways. You don't necessarily have to go to college and pay for tuition to learn how to live independently. //   I think the most important thing is then to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge, and the word as well, because, um, for as much as I'm paying here and all the classes that I'm required to take that aren't necessarily part of my core curriculum, and that with the unique experiences I've had interacting with people from different parts of the world, and different walks of life, I think have been the most, um, transformative and important for me. // Interviewer:  Great. What motivated you to participate in the interview today?    Interviewee:  Um, I can see the importance of studies that are like this. I think it's kind of a way of paying it forwards if I'm running a study in the future that I need subjects for, hopefully people will help with that, right?    Interviewer:  Yeah, definitely.

Kids will be like, ""I wanna to be a dentist. I wanna be a Business Major or something."" But going to college, when you can take... For your major, when you can take up to six courses, that really go in-depth in that area, you really get a close look at it and you get to decide whether that's something you wanna do instead of saying like just having...

I think another thing is learning to live independently, letting them to pursue...

[2015 MEDIUM: Described as being a defining feature of why people could not all go to college, mentioned the importance of learning to manage finances (Which can be learned in college). one of the curriculum changes is to have a class on personal finance]    QUOTES: 08:22 S1: Is it important to go to college, for people, in general, to go to college?     08:28 S2: It's a good question. I don't think college is for everything.    08:34 S1: Okay.    08:36 S2: I think, it's a very costly experience... It's an expensive experience that might not make sense for someone whose interested in pursuing more of a professional or vocational career. That being said, in an Utopian society, I think everyone would go to college because if you look at it sort of from a justice standpoint and seems kind of unfair that people with the resources and money can go to college whereas people without those resources don't have the option. But, I think that if we... We need people who are just sort of going to go into the workforce after high school, because I think like bolstering middle class and having that sort of aspect of our society is equally important. I think we just need to put more value into that and respect those types of careers. Because, college is such a costly... It's really expensive, so it doesn't make sense for everyone to go to college.    10:03 S1: You mentioned that if it was a perfect world, a Utopian society, everyone would have the opportunity to go. And, if in a hypothetical situation that could be something that would be possible, why do you feel like that would be such an ideal situation? What are people getting out of college that makes it important or to build a perfect place?     10:29 S2: Yeah. Well, I think there is a lot of benefit in education in terms of self-empowerment and understanding. And I think, in a Utopian society, everyone have the opportunity to go to college and become self-empowered and sort of explore the world. I don't know. It's... I've always thought that education is really, really important, and people who have more education are able to make more informed decisions. They are able to seek out resources that they might not know about. It's good for your health. I think if you're educated, you know what to do when you are sick or not feeling well. An economic standpoint, it might help you make better decisions about, where you invest your money, or...  //  11:43 S1: Now, thinking a little bit about the curriculum of the college. Let's say, again, hypothetical situation, you could be the Dean of Tufts and you could start from scratch and design your own program for students to take while they're at their college for four years, what would that program look like? What kinds of knowledge or information do you think it's most important for students to be exposed to and to learn?     12:12 S2: I think, I would keep our foreign language requirement, because I think that's a really important skill in this new age. [chuckle] I think... Let's see, I think some sort of social justice curriculum would be interesting, and... It's funny you asked because I'm just, I'm in a class where we're required to design a high school.    12:42 S1: Oh, that's so funny. [chuckle]    12:43 S2: Yeah. So, I was sort of thinking about the curriculum we designed for our high school. I think that it could be applicable to a university. We have a social justice curriculum. So, all the students are required to take classes, like Identity in Voices and Financial Literacy and Civics. I think, focusing on what's going to make you an active citizen, after graduation, is important for the curriculum. I personally wish there was a class here just about basic finance.    13:23 S1: People have mentioned that, not just at Tufts, but at a lot of different schools so far that there are math requirements, but it would be great if there was a Personal Finance, like a math that you could use and you could learn about math, but you could also actually take something with you for the future.    13:38 S2: Yeah, I really wish that existed here, because there is a math requirement, but the math classes are like Symmetry and Math of Social Choice, and it's just... Things that I won't use in the real world. I think, the best curriculum is a curriculum that's going to prepare you for life beyond college, whether that's your own career or... But also, how you sort of... How you vote, where you put your resources, your priorities like... Yeah, I took a class on the school systems in the US and I think that every one should know about schools, because everyone, or most people are going to have kids, and they are going to send them to school, and...  //  41:43 S1: So, at this point, I have a kind of exercise, where I'm gonna have you put yourself in the shoes of some of the other groups of people that we're gonna be talking to, about what they think the goals are, of the college experience. So, if you can imagine from the point of view of parents of students what do you think that they would say are the goals of the college experience?     42:06 S2: So I think a parent would say, ""I want my kid to get a job."" Because they are investing a lot of resources into their child's education. They want it to pay off in future.   //  55:36 S2: Yeah. I guess, this will probably help you like, the interview will help you determine this but... My friends and I one time had a conversation about like, if we would go back and do these four years over again, would we go to college? Would we invest the money? And I think that is sort of answered.    55:55 S1: Well, kind of. I mean, is it important to go and that sort of thing. But I guess, one thing that... If you could go back, would you do it, would you do the same thing or would you go somewhere different? Is there any... Are there any changes that you would've made? If you could go back in time and talk to your 17-year-old self?     56:15 S2: Yeah. I would definitely go back, because I think I've made the most of my experience here, not just academically, but also outside of the classroom. I've always tried to go to lectures, and...

It was beautiful, it was far away where I didn’t have to see anyone, not too many kids go there from my high school, I mean, enough, but not like too much, so I was like, oh, I’ll stay away from my parents, I’ll stay away from all my friends in my graduating class, blah, blah, blah, but then I realized, due to some cultural differences there, specifically the drug problem, the type of people it would attract and the tuition being more than $50,000 a year for a state school, and obviously they’re not going to have an endowment or financial  aid to hand out to us out-of-staters, not to mention in general, so it was heartbreaking, but I had realized that I can’t go there.  I had only applied to three schools: Dartmouth, UNH and UVM, and UNH was kind of my safety school because I had family in the area, about 20 minutes from here, and I knew the area and we would come down here for indoor track, we would use their facilities, so I knew the campus, and when I figured out I was coming here I figured there would have to be a time when I had to stop hating this place and resenting it just because it’s not UVM.  And so I started coming here a little more often and visiting my friends here, talking to them, this is classes above me who came here, and they were really passionate about it, so I said, Ok, I’ll see how it goes, and coming into this, I was kind of like, and this is just me being me, a little cautious, but it’s a really great school.  I’m really happy I came here, it was a better fit than I ever would have imagined it becoming. // Interviewee:	Ok, well, the biggest pain in my rear end are your core common requirements because they want to you to graduate as a well-rounded student.  To be quite honest, I don’t give a rat’s behind about humanities or about fine arts – I just, I don’t and I know I have to take it, but luckily UNH offers classes that have  -it’s one class but it has the credit of another.  Like, just last semester I knocked out a natural resources credit by taking environmental awareness and conservation issues and ok, it wasn’t really my cup of tea, but I learned something from it.  I mean, of course, going into it I was like, this is going to be terrible, but a) I knocked out a requirement, b) I learned a lot, and c) I walked out of that thinking that I walked away with knowledge that I’m going to live with about how in trouble we are.  So how I would design this program? I would try to be more lenient with these requirements.  I don’t think I’m going to use fine arts, that’s not really an interest to me, lucky for me I can knock a fine arts requirement out of the way with German.  When I go over to Germany for the summer I’ll take a German literature and theater class when I’m over in Berlin, and so that actually, that’s going to be fun because a) it’s in my major and b) it’s in Germany.  So that’s really cool, but – definitely maybe some more – what I’ve noticed is that some kids are way ahead of others, depending on where they’re coming from - high schools, and I know with the bigger sized state schools or any school that has a large amount of students is going to struggle with this, because all these kids are coming in with all these different educations – maybe some quick little standardized test – I did it for my math level to see what math I belonged in, same with the French and the Spanish, those are the most common.  There’s always placements tests for those – but perhaps have placement tests to see what – are you above entry level?  Are you below entry level?  Do you know what – where do you stand?  Because I like the feeling of kind of being a – it’s kind of contradictory, but I like the idea of being a number here, I don’t necessarily like standing out, at the same time I don’t feel like I’ve lost my individuality.  And I want other students to be able to feel that too.  So by kind of making a personalized learning plan – that way they’ll know that their plan isn’t going to be like Joe’s, and Julia’s plan isn’t going to be like Kelly’s, and it’s going to be individualized.  And I like that.  I know it’s a lot of work, but it could really benefit some kids and save a lot of time and a lot of their money. // Interviewee: 	I have a commuter friend and he’s finding it pretty hard to make friends because the food here – because it’s so good, is quite expensive.  So if he wants food he wants to go home.  He doesn’t want to pay for it.  And that’s totally understandable.  Although it’s his choice, there’s a lot of  - you don’t get to meet as many people, and like I said, we’re not too close of a floor, but I’ve met a lot of girls – I know them enough to say hi to them.  I’ve met a lot of people at socials.  And people you normally wouldn’t meet- of all kinds.  Just kind of around.  I was in the kitchen first semester and right below me is a lounge and there was a piano and I heard someone playing beautifully so I ran downstairs and made a friend. // Interviewee:	They’re all kind of important to me.  Ok.  These are all really tough to separate.  Getting a job is pretty important ‘cause I have to pay back all those loans, but I would say to gain different perspectives on people, knowledge, that would be number one.

(laughs)   //Hm, I want to add that I don't regret being at Queens College. Like although it wasn't my first choice, and although I had to go there because of money, it's the same situation as like when I, when I got into Forest Hills High School. I didn't want to go there. I wanted to go to Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, you know?

In my opinion, if I'm paying to be here, and I would need to miss more than three classes, that's the general rule, if you miss more than three classes, your grade is automatically like a D or something like that. I don't like that because I'm paying the be here and then if I can pass the class... And I can pass the class and have great grades and come out with the B+ and miss five classes of the course in the semester, why should I be penalized with that? So those are the three. // 16:52 S1: Sure.

And have you engaged in any learning experiences outside of the classroom?     16:48 S2: Yeah, so my freshman and this is my freshman-sophomore year, I took a whole course on currency trading.    16:55 S1: What was that?     16:56 S2: Currency trading. So trading international currencies in the Forex market, so the foreign exchange market. So I took probably about over a year of training in how to trade currencies, and so that was like on top of my other studies and stuff. So that was one thing that I did. And then, I think the most knowledge that I have actually gotten out of Duke was just my time reading other interesting business books that I, just on the side, I started reading about one a month and I think I've gotten more knowledge out of that than anything that I've actually learned in here, 'cause it's just books that I find interesting and that are actually useful for me, so I'd consider that an outside study.  //  21:45 S1: Cool.

But I don't know. // 0:11:23 S1: Well, I mean, you shouldn't have to continue taking English Gen Eds or Language Gen Eds if you've decided from the Gen Ed program that you wanna do Math.    0:11:31 S2: Yeah.    0:11:32 S1: Then it should be a... I don't know, it doesn't make any sense to...    0:11:36 S2: It should be a more personalized experience?     0:11:38 S1: Right, because it's college and that's personalized if nothing else and mostly because you're paying for it. It's not like high school, where the country or something mandates it. No. You chose to go to a school, you are paying them, you shouldn't have to be told what to take. // 0:12:41 S1: I definitely don't think a college graduate is a, treated as like a generalized term. I think that definitely, a high school graduate or a high school graduate should know how to work computers. A high school graduate should have read ""The Great Gatsby"" or ""The Scarlet Letter"" or whatever they do. Those things are for high school people. That's what our country-wide mandate education should be requiring. A college graduate, I mean, you don't have degrees in a college. We have degrees in Math or degrees in Russian, or you know. So my degree only shows a school that I spent time learning Russian, that I spent time focusing on Russian, learning about the culture, whatever, and that's what it should show, that your degree is personalized and it's specific. If you go to a vocational school and you got a degree in Auto-Mechanics or something like that, that's what it shows; that's what you've bought, that's what you've paid for, and that's what you graduated with. // There's also programs, lots of religious events, and club events, and other religions that you wouldn't normally think about or know about kind of things. A lot of our events are, well, I would say free, but we kind of had already paid for them, out of your tuition, anyway, kind of thing. // 0:54:37 S1: And get involved on campus. I know that they say that a whole lot, there's posters everywhere that say that. And I don't mean like, you know, become president or something like that. If you don't wanna do that, that's fine but the campus just has so much to offer and you're already paying for all of it, so you might as well at least try, try stuff. // I'd definitely do a lot more of the exercise group classes that we offer on campus. They're offering such good ones, but I work, and I work two jobs and I take five classes, and I teach, so I am constantly be busy. So, anything I do, exercise-wise, I have to do after 6:00 PM or onwards. But I love them, so I try to make time for them. // 0:55:48 S2: Okay, well then maybe, do you think that there's an important book or maybe an important learning experience that you think every college student should have before leaving college, before graduating?     [background noise]    0:56:11 S1: I don't like generalizing, so it's really hard for me... I guess, I think, an important experience to have... I think an important experience to have before you go to college is just that there needs to be something before you go to college that happens to you, that happens for you, that makes you think, ""Okay, it helped find the way or this has to find a way, and now I'm ready to go to college to focus on exactly what I wanna do."" And for me, that was studying abroad that made me realize, just knowing that that was the direction that I want to take with my life. And I don't wanna say generally that everyone needs to study abroad 'cause it's like...    0:56:49 S2: Yeah.    0:56:50 S1: An eye opening experience like it was for me, but you need to have some kind of eye-opening experience before you go to college. I think one of the worst things you could do for yourself... And unfortunately, a lot of students have to 'cause they can't afford to do anything else; but it's to go to high school in the same city and then go to college in the same city. If you're doing that, you're not giving yourself any chance to hit some sort of speed bump or to hit some sort of experience where you think, ""I've never done this before, I'm terrified to do this,"" but you do it anyway and learn for yourself how you accomplish that or how you could get over that. I don't think that it's just a book and I don't think there's one specific book that ever college student should read or needs to read and be all set for life. I don't think that's how that works. // 1:01:50 S2: Why do you think that there are more Asian international students?     1:01:54 S1: I actually happen to know why there are because I work in the President's Office. It's... We made a gap program two years ago for them because they... Honestly, it's finances, because they can afford to come here and [1:02:10] ____ that's what it is. I'm sure that we put out a different message for it, but I know that's why it is, so. College is a business now, right?  //"

Like if their main point is to get a job, then I don't think you should have to do that many electives.

Interviewee:	Well, it, it, it got to a point where, um, after my first two semesters, I was offered a scholarship with another advisory group, because of the connections I had made in my first two semesters. There's an out-and-to program where, um, they, I take five courses a semester for 15 credits a semester, and if you have to take a summer course or two to make up the difference, you do that, but...you get out in two years and go right to, you know, your four-year college after your associate's degree, and, um, that was all...uh, advisor-driven.  // Interviewer:	Right...okay.

It's a tough balance.    0:07:09 S2: It's a hard balance to strike."" // "". I'm just so overwhelmed with the homework and the papers, and now as a senior thinking about post-college, and where am I going to live, and money, and... It's too much to think about at once. And I really am just doing the bare minimum to actually get through my classes, finding out what I really need to do to get the grade. And I don't know so much if that's a goal, but I feel like it really just has been, especially since sophomore year, just to survive until graduation, and to really figure out how am I going to support myself after college."" //  // ""0:09:04 S2: Yeah, a lot. A lot. There really aren't resources, I think, at colleges, in general, to accommodate students who have complicated backgrounds. What I mean by that is, my mother passed away...    0:09:23 S1: Oh, I'm so sorry.    0:09:24 S2: When I was still a high school student, and my father has never really been there. And I've been in ups and downs at the financial aid office, trying to get financial aid, which has jumped all around over the last four years. Even little things like how they tend to kick everyone off campus for winter break, and they make an exception for a handful of students who are really in the need, but mostly just for international students. And I think that doesn't really take into consideration the students who don't have anywhere to go."" // "": Like, I know I'm not the only one. I can't be the only one on this entire campus who doesn't have a real place to call home. I can't be the only one on campus who started the school year with $5 to their name. There has to have... There's no support system for people like that"" // ""0:11:18 S2: Yeah, right, exactly. And so I recognize... It's frustrating. Because I recognize that at the end of the day, college is just, it's really nothing more than a business. You look at the amount of student loan debt that people have. I myself about 12, a little over $12,000 in debt, and you look at even little things like the fact that we have to pay to use the ping pong table on the campus center. My dorm doesn't have a proper kitchen sink and yet the gym was renovated completely, three years ago. It's all a facade and it's all about money, and I guess that's probably why there really isn't a whole lot of catering to people who are in this institution who do not have money, but that makes it a real struggle to keep going through the system at all."" // ""0:12:26 S2: I no longer think it is important for people to go to college. I guess it's somewhat hard, because I feel I'm weird, because on one hand I'm a minority and yet on another hand I am a minority in a privileged institution. So I guess I kind of see both sides of the issue. However, in a weird sense, I'm almost lucky because my complicated situation has made it so that I almost graduated college without having to take out a loan. The $12,000, about $11,000 of that is dedicated to a language program I did last summer at Newbury College."" // ""0:13:12 S2: I essentially could've graduated with almost no loans whatsoever, because I am too poor. But I am poor enough for my school to give me significant financial aid. However, there are people in situations close to mine, who haven't gotten any money, or do not get anywhere near as much money as I do. And I look at these people, 40, 50, $80,000 in debt. And I look at the struggle, and I look at people like that, who have graduated and work at Starbucks, and if they managed to get a job at all. And I think about, for an industry like web development, for example, where you don't need a college degree, and other jobs where they focus more on what skills do you have and not what your GPA is."" // ""0:14:01 S2: It really doesn't seem like you need college anymore. As it is now, I feel stressed, because I don't feel like I have any marketable skills, besides maybe now my language that I went into debt for, to actually use for an employer. I'm an English major. I've only ever worked on this campus at a few random offices. I don't really have anything, I feel like, I can bring to the table, skill-wise. And so in college classes, maybe unless you're an Engineer, or your going Pre-Med, they do not give that to you. A Liberal Arts education is dead. It is dead, dead. There is so much like a... A college degree does not ensure you a job, like it might have 50 years ago. It doesn't."" // ""0:30:28 S2: The benefits. One, it's just close to everything. I mean, living off-campus you can live pretty far off-campus, and I would understand that for people who need to save money, but it really does make things convenient. I think it might feel a little safer, also. I'd say... I'd say, I don't know. If you're getting financial aid it might be cheaper, but I haven't actually done the math to figure all that out. It's convenient in a lot of ways in just that you don't... I don't know the buildings are right there, the classes are right there, you're on campus, you're right in the heart of everything. They don't really have to worry about furniture or whatever being provided for you, or paying bills and such, and... Yeah."" // ""0:50:40 S1: And what about trustees, so the people who are on the boards that govern the school. How do you think that they might answer that question?     0:50:53 S2: That's a hard one. That's a hard one, because I feel like trustees are always those people in the background, you never see, you know just have hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're just monopolizing, puppeteering the entire scene beforehand. I don't know, I picture trustees like this group of co-conspirators who participate in students' depression or participate in all the things that cause student depression and student debt, and all that stuff.

And it's like a really good school for the state and um, tuition affected my decision a lot and so obviously since it's in state it's a lot cheaper than going out of state. // I think that they need to make it, like mandatory to take like, financial classes because I know that for me it's hard because I won't know how to like, pay bills or anything like the 'cause it's not classes that I'm required to take and I don't know that I'll have time to take them.

Um, but college is really helpful to help you live independently because you're on your own in an environment and you're still a little supported, so it's kind of that in between. So, it's really helpful in that aspect. Um, to gain different perspectives I would be as three because it's important to, you meet a ton of different people from a ton of different backgrounds, and so you can learn a lot about people that way. And then, to study a particular content area, I put as last because, although you do have your major and like, you're focusing on that, you still have like, your general education requirements and you're still kind of like, branching out and I don't think that you should limit yourself to just one area. // "

Like, we'd be in the lines basically asking TAs questions, and so like, I did not do well at all, and I had to pick a different major basically, and I kind of panicked and just picked psychology because my mom is a therapist and so it just ... I was like, ""All right, well, I think I know enough about this. I could at least like, feel comfortable in it.""    	And I've kind of always been interested in like, foreign policy and, um, law enforcement and just, the concept of justice, so when I found out there was a dual major, I just would apply it, and then a lot of my courses could be double-dipped to get the forensics minor, so I figured I might just do that as well 'cause it's my ...

So is it important to go to college?     11:05 S2: That is a good question. I think at some levels it would be a yes. In others it would be a no, 'cause much as I like being $20,000 indebted, if it all works out in the end, then I'd say, ""Yes"", but for some people who think they need to go to college, it's a priority for them to go just to have the college experience, I don't think it'd be worth it.    11:40 S1: Okay. So just to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying, it's important for you, if at the end you get a job or a career that would be helpful to you, but it might not be important if it's just for the college experience. So for a little bit of the academics, but also other things.    12:05 S2: Yeah.  //  14:01 S2: Okay. Let's see. I put get a job, 1. I would do study a particular content area in depth, 2. Gain a different perspective on people, knowledge and the world, 3 and then learn to live independently, 4.    14:21 S1: Okay. So any particular comments about that?     14:29 S2: Nope. Learn to live independently, I lived at Rivier for my freshman year on campus, with a roommate. And it wasn't really, I don't know, great for me.

Let's say, obviously getting a job is 1 'cause college for me has just been advancement to knowledge so you can get a better job. And then just study in particular content area in depth, would just be like an add on to that first one.  //  20:10 S1: Okay. What about if you thought for a minute about online courses, writing courses, or public speaking course, freshmen seminars. Are there other kinds of elements that you think would be important for college students, in terms of curriculum?     20:31 S2: I think a freshman seminar and I know every year they do a junior seminar, but I think, even a senior-type quick little seminar class, wouldn't be awful, because they're still a lot of stuff not related by majors, that they can't do, like taxes and stuff. Just things that was never taught in high school, things that I was never taught in college, that apply to everyday life, I think that would be helpful.    21:05 S1: Okay. Could you think for a minute... I mean, taxes, that's a great example. Are there other kinds of things that you wished you had learned about in college that you didn't?     21:14 S2: I think it's mostly just financial stuff. I wouldn't know how to go about getting a loan or buying any sort of major properties or like a car.  //  I took one online course, 'cause I was behind in some credits, 'cause I didn't take more classes one year.

I'd say, 1, get enough sleep. 2, manage your time, doing homework and going to class. And 3, I'd take advantage of what UNH has to offer.    40:48 S1: Okay. And do you have anything specific in mind, in terms of those offerings?     40:56 S2: I'd say, use... We have a student activities fee, that you already paid for, and there's plenty of events that you can go to. There's a bunch of TEDx talks I know that we do, that are always good to go to.

If you're a self, like if you can teach yourself and you have access to resources that you can learn and like if you're drawn to be an entrepreneur and you can self-educate and you have a computer and you can go to seminars and you can network with people.

I've learned so much like about like intersexuality and stuff that like maybe if I was just focusing on creating writing I wouldn't have learned. Or the history of sexuality and its like helped with my writing too. So if you're learning like those types of things on your own, like if you're reading [inaudible 00:13:14], if you're doing that, I guess it's good.

And that's where I went to high school and that's my hometown. I decided on UNH because it's in state and it's close. I could get a lot of money to go to Suffolk, but it didn't offer housing for after first year and I know living down there is really expensive, so I just went with UNH.   //  03:48 S1: And what were your goals for your college experience?     03:51 S2: My goals were basically to get out, do well enough to get into the law school, and build my resume and character in the process. But I knew all along what I wanted to do with my further education and I kinda needed to balance that because I knew I was going to be taking the LSAT, and I knew I have to maintain a job through college to afford a lot of things. So just along as I got out with grades that I needed. That's what I needed from undergraduate.  //  04:30 S1: Did you have to have a job while you were at school?     04:35 S2: Yeah. I did work at the Portsmouth Brewery for a few years and then I decided my senior year that I didn't want a job anymore and I actually left there. Because I really needed to study for my LSAT and that's why I couldn't balance it, 'cause I was doing like 50 hours a week while in school.    04:56 S1: Wow. That's a lot.    04:57 S2: And, it was. It was just too much and I just wanted to... I just had the realization one time. I was at a UNH football game and my boss called me and I said ""yeah"" and then afterwards it was ""I don't wanna do this anymore. I just wanna enjoy my senior life"" and then I left the job shortly after so I could enjoy myself more and focus on my last year.    05:20 S1: Wow. That's a lot of hours to have to work while also handling a full course load.

What kinds of knowledge or information are most important for students to be exposed to and to learn?     08:09 S2: I think everyone can benefit from courses like economics, or not even just like macro, microeconomics, but classes that will help us more in the real world. Because I mean, I'm at home right now right after college and it's like, I grew academically, but I'm still like if you ask me to file my W2s, I have no idea, or things like... I don't know, just the real world skills like... Even cooking, that sounds silly, but a lot of people don't know how to cook unless someone's providing for them or just do their taxes or how to correctly manage your funds and do your cheque book.    08:59 S2: Some people don't even know how to write a cheque nowadays and I think like that's sad. And it's not something that you learn in college, it's kind of passed on through your family. Or how to buy insurance, or how to pick a house and sign a mortgage correctly without needing a lawyer present or... It's just things that I still don't know, but I'll probably learn from my parents, but not everyone is close with their parents as I am. So...    09:27 S1: Yeah, some people are on their own and they need to know how to do these things.    09:31 S2: Exactly.    09:32 S1: So maybe some more real world applications.    09:36 S2: Yes. Not so much like memorize this information on a history test and goodbye.    09:43 S1: Are there any other kinds of courses or things that people should be learning while they're at college?     09:57 S2: Sometimes I find that the requirements required for any major, aren't applicable to the major. And I think that Gen Eds should be more, you can choose what you want instead of you have to take a history class from level 500 to 600, but they tell you that, and then you take... This is actually personal experience, I took a history class to meet the Gen ed requirement and they were like, ""No, it has to be European History, not American History"". So, if you can count, it's just I think that's absolutely ridiculous. And it happens with a lot of majors. Why do I have to take that, it doesn't apply to my major and I'm paying for the classes. So I would like to choose what I can take, I would have loved to replace that with an economics class or something, but you can't do that. They're so cookie cutter...  //  35:27 S1: Have you been involved with any different groups on campus? Like extracurricular groups?     35:34 S2: Not really on campus.

That's one of my biggest regrets was not getting involved on campus. I don't think students should work unless it's a minimum amount of hours to get some pocket money because I think that really took away from... I guess... I don't know. My focus on school in general.

They can't fit everybody and they can't pay for everybody to go there, and I think that things exist like Coursera, where you can learn anything, um, get a certificate for it, which is what, like forty-five dollars? Compared to, I don't know, worked it out, like worked the math out, what, like, thirty thousand dollars in tuition per semester. Take four classes, like seventy-five hundred dollars. // Interviewee:  So I think it's really weird that Duke forces you to essentially sign to stay on campus for three years and it's only a four years or four year degree so you're basically only allowed to live off campus for one.    Interviewer:  Right.    Interviewee:  And it's so much cheaper and I think that's also another thing. Um, I was on like the executive board for like the sororities here at group and that was a big issue with like our housing in the sororities, you kind of housing, but the university, the administration wants there to be seniors living in a house, and that's probably like the only real mandate that students have to stay on campus and it's really weird because it's the only freedom you have as a senior, is, you get to be a part time student your senior spring, and then you can only you can pay like half tuition which is great, if you're done with all your credits, and you can live off campus. So it's kind of weird because it's so expensive to live on campus where it's like, my perfect, my dining plan was like, covered by [inaudible 00:31:41] thirty-three hundred dollars, and like my friends who lived off campus senior year, could not have spent that much money unless they ate out every other day...It's just ridiculous because, yes I'm financial aid so this is essentially free money, that I'm just spending Duke's money and giving it back to it, but somebody who's not on financial aid, that's a lot of money. And, if you don't need to be spending that, like, I'm pretty sure the amount they covered needs, like room and board, could have been put a very nice apart and they've got some really great new apartment complexes opening up here, that I am sure that could have been well spent. // one it was the Amazon gift card, will basically will hell to get me to do just about anything."

I didn't have to move out, my parents weren't able to afford, you know, paying for rent for me to move somewhere else, so I didn't want to take out a student loan because, like I was afraid of student debt. And you know, for the, for the ... so what I'm going to school for it's not something that'll pay off that debt. I'm going to school to be a teacher, so you know, the income won't, it won't help. So I didn't want to be placed into a debt, plus I heard that the teaching program at CSUN was a really good one, so. // Uh, definitely the computer lab that gives you free printing. That's really, that's been a big help for me. The SRC, the new recreation center, the gym that we have, it's a big one too. Um, it has a lot of like, classes that are free and a lot, a lot of things that you can use in there.    We also have like, what is it called? The L something, RC, something. I don't know (laughs). So many acronyms, but um, it basically helps you with writing and I don't know, there's so many things that we have (laughs). Uh, we have like this school therapist there, which is really cool, I like to use that. And the Quat Center, which is the health center, I use that a lot too. // Uh, yeah, definitely the course material. Um, it took a lot of studying and figuring out before I kind of adjusted to like, what a syllabus was, or buying text books, or you know, filing for financial aid, all of the paperwork involved, or all of the documents you have to turn in, that was a pretty rough transition. // Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- and have you, uh, have you been engaged in any learning experiences outside of the classroom? //     Interviewee:	Oh yeah, definitely, um. Oh outside of the classroom?    Interviewer:	Yeah, outside of the classroom.

Organize what, you know, all the dates, the due dates, um. Have something for daily tasks. Uh, keep a calendar, you know, use google calendar, or something. Um, definitely, because you can get lost. Um, another thing, um, you know, seek out any school help resources money wise, I'd say. Um, you know, there's tons of scholarships out there that are willing to help you. Make sure you know how to apply for FAFSA. Um, you know, just anything that'll guide you through it and then, you know, later on, it's gonna be a piece of cake.

Yeah we're really close to Chicago but the people that are here, they do offer good scholarships and that. Just a lot of people abhor to go here which I think has a skewed way of thinking.

Um, so I feel like it shouldn't be required that sophomores live on campus, I don't really think that there is any purpose behind it. We do have this program, um, for second years, where you live on campus and stuff like that but I feel like that should be a choice that people make if they want to partake in this, um, STEP program is what it's called.    Um, like they choose to do that and live on campus but I don't think that it's beneficial for all second years to live on campus if they don't want to just because we've already, you know, I've met so many people, I'm already accustomed to, like to going to university that I just that it's, um, kind of a waste of money, in my opinion."" // ""So like you're just left with this college degree and there are no jobs for you?

You know, I fell like you should be able to kind of come back from any disadvantages, um look at it in a different perspective, um, look at in a different light and see how you can make it po, you can turn something negative into a positive way.

Additionally, a lot of her choices at Queens have been influenced by money (not living on campus, using the library, joining certain groups because they had free food), and she clearly views money as important generally. // QUOTES: Interviewee:	So, I was out of school for a couple years and, um, I graduated in Nassau Community College with my associate's in 2014.  	Um, and, I just ... I was working, like ... I was working two jobs and I was making, like, no money. And, I just realized that I needed to do something, so I remembered people in high school, one of my math teachers, um, that always, like, stands out to me in my alternative high school, I should say.  	Um, he went to Queens College and I just remember, like, everybody is like, ""Oh, Queens College is a great school for teaching especially."" And, um ... yeah, I don't know. I just took the leap, decided to apply and that's where I got accepted. // Interviewee:	That is a tough question. Um, yes. I do think it's important to go to college, but I know some people who are very smart and successful without a college degree. And, I know people who are going to make more money than me without a college degree and I know people, right now, who are making more money than, like, my friends, for example, who have college degrees.

(laughs)  	And, I ... that was, like, one of my, like, major turnoffs. // Interviewee:	Um, we have an awesome library. I mean, it's ... it's, like, a huge library. Uh, there's MacBooks and, um, uh ... aside from physical books, but ... yeah, I think that's, like, attractive to students because, you know, the ... the obvious thing. MacBooks are expensive and ... and, I know a lot of people on-campus use them, so maybe they feel, like, ""Oh, okay. The library is a good resource for me because they have the same computer that I use and I know how to use it"", and maybe they're thinking, like, ""Oh, okay. They're actually putting some money and, uh, spending the money on the ... the MacBooks."" Um, uh, what else? There's a lot of ... I ... I've never attended any, but I know there's a lot of, like, study sessions that they do. Um, um, yeah, they were ... I got an email last week. It was about ... they have, like, snacks and studies.  	So, I know they, um, do, like, a lot of food bribery, I guess-  	(laughs)  	To try to get the people to attend. // Interviewee:	So, this semester, um, definitely, balance since I'm taking so many credits.

Interviewee:	Oh, I babysit and I work at a yoga studio on Saturdays, um, so just basically trying to maintain and balance everything. Uh, you know, I also wanna have a social life maybe, which definitely is, kind of ... I ... I don't wanna say it's nonexistent, but it's ... it's ... it's hard. It's hard to maintain friendships on top of everything else, especially when I go out with my friends.

It's really, I think, just everything that I've experienced, both, like, in school and out of school in the past two years since I started at Queens College has just been, like, a transformation for me, but there's nothing, like, I mean ... I guess, before I started school, I just, you know ... I said I was working my two jobs and that was, kind of, like, a aha moment, like, ""I can't keep doing this if I want ...

I saw the, um, ad on-campus, like, walking to my literature class one day. And, I was ... I saw $50. Obviously, I was interested, uh, because I get a lot of stuff from Amazon in general, but, um, like ... even textbooks and everything. Um, I wasn't really sure what to expect from the interview, but, uh, I feel like it was definitely beneficial, like, that I thought about everything, what I said and, kind of, made me reflect on the past two years of my life and, like, why I chose to college and, like, what I plan to get out of it and everything.

LASCAP2156,P073,School 2,High Importance,Seniors,"HIGH: RATIONALE: The participant brings up money in the context of academic and non academic realms. She also has an off campus job, cites cost as a main reason for attending CSUN, and the gift card as the reason for participating. // QUOTES: [Oh, okay. (laughs) So why did you choose to go to CSUN over any of the other schools that you might have been looking at or ones that you even applied to?]    Um, one, proximity.    Uh, that's a big one. How close it was. I mean, from where I was at the time it was only 30 minutes and then we actually moved closer, which I'm literally like five minutes away now. Um, so that's nice. Uh, proximity, cost, also. That's a big one.    How cheap it was and then there was one other item ... Oh! 'Cause of their teaching program. 'Cause I'm going to be a teacher and they are known for having like one of the best teaching programs around here, so ...    So, that's the reason.  //Um, I guess- What? That's not one word. (laughs) I was gonna say ""budget-conscious"". But that's not-    [Okay.]    That's not one word, but does that work?    [It works. That's fine, yeah, budget-conscious. So, why would you say that?]    Just, I mean there's, there's other words that I can think of, 'cause they're like small cliques, but like as a whole I feel like a lot of people at CSUN go there because it is a cheaper option and so they, like, do community college, get that done and then they'll transfer over to CSUN or they'll go to CSUN instead of doing it at a UC, just because it is cheaper-//Let's see. What else? Curriculum-wise? Um, I think also, just, they have this, it takes so many, I don't know, I assuming this is mostly just for the teaching program. But they have a so many, like, uh, state tests that we have to pass before we can move on in or program. That's expensive.    Very expensive, uh, 'cause we spent, for one test, it was $300 and then another is $171.    So, yeah. So, they're, they're really expensive tests and they're long tests, but I mean, I know, I know part of the profession and that's more of like a California law. We can't really change that at our school, um, um. //Um, a disadvantage of being a commuter student is definitely finding parking at CSUN.    [Sure.]    Parking is a nightmare over there.    And it's expensive, so you get a parking pass. You pay ... They just raised it. I think it's $360 for a year.    [Oh, my God. (laughing)]    So, you know, $360 for a year and, uh, that does not guarantee you a parking spot.    [Oh.]    Yeah. So that, that's one thing that's definitely, the disadvantage of it.    //it's kind of like a tutoring center. But basically anything you have questions on, you can go in and they'll help you out.    Uh, and it's free, which is also good. So, ... Or, I guess I should say included in our tuition.    (laughs) But, it's not really free. Uh, that is definitely one really good resource. For teachers, they have the, it's called the TCC. It's a library, basically, for teachers.    It's fantastic, 'cause they have these different children's books and, uh, educational books and it's amazing. For us and they-    ... even have a little work station, where we can make, um, stuff for our classrooms. So that's really helpful. Um, computer labs, those are helpful, just for getting stuff done. Printing labs. Those are very nice too. We get, uh, 20 free prints a day. So, if like you need to print something, you don't have a printer at home, that's awesome. And then they also give you $10 free every semester for printing, so ...    ... that's nice too.    //(laughs) Um, I definitely say you have to have some kind of back-up plan.    That's obvious. Like, you can't, you can't just go in, like looking at one thing. I mean, if you need to stay in school for a little bit longer, you might have to and just work like one job like right now, I'm a waitress, myself.    You might just have to work until you can get through college and get a job that you could do or you could start working at a, like do some kind of an internship and maybe you can go up from there.    Yeah, if the job disappears, that really sucks.//But I also feel like if you go to a school like the UC, then or a private school, like you get a lot more experiences, 'cause you have like that extra money. You can do stuff like that.

First, there is mention of receiving a fairly significant amount of scholarship/aid from DePaul that was decisive in the college decision-making process. In addition, the job focus seems directly tied to monetary concerns; the participant discusses the state of the economy with great personal concern. The importance of college is also framed in specifically monetary ways about the hourly wage of a plumber, not just that they are necessary. // QUOTES ""Great. And when you were deciding where to go to college, what made you choose DePaul over other schools?    I got a lot of money from DePaul. I got a decent amount of money, and I like Chicago. I like Chicago. I don't mind leaving Chicago, but it's not terrible. It's not the worst thing in the world to stay here.    Do you remember other places you applied that you were considering?    Spellman.    Spellman.    I got into Spellman, and I would have gone if money hadn't been an issue."" //  ""Do you think it's important to go to college in general?    Yeah, but it depends on what you want to do. Nowadays you can't find a plumber that you pay less than 75 an hour.    You can't find what?    A plumber. Nobody's getting GED's anymore. There are no trade schools, which is very important."" // ""Do you think there's anything that everybody should get out of their college education by the time they graduate? Like any certain skill, or subject area that everybody should learn?    Everybody ... Speaking is very important. I think that everybody should be a good public speaker. Can I change that?    Yeah, sure.    Everybody should know how to file taxes and do important financial things that nobody teaches us.    Unless you're a business major, they don't teach you that."" // ""Okay, that's fine. You haven't really mentioned the Vincentian mission of DePaul. How do you think that it plays into your experience as a student, or the school in general.    The school overall is extremely giving. I don't know if it's because of Vincentianism, or if it's because most people are paying 38,000 for tuition, it's extremely important. It's a great ideal no matter what religion you're in, or what faith you practice. The idea of community and all this other stuff is so important."" "

I'm actually thinking of maybe doing my last semester (laughs) abroad in South Korea again, if the financial aid is available. // Um, I'd say that they're very, um, dedicated.

I know a lot, I know a lot of schools who kind of have that, um, what you call it? The, the party, the, the, you know, fetes. And like, I mean, we do have that, but I think like it's mostly ...

But the thing is ... that surprises me, that always makes me upset, (laughs) is just that my mum does her taxes really, really early, so when I do my FAFSA, like, I feel like no one else has done it, because I do it super early. Like, as soon as it's ... Like, when it's the season to do taxes, my mom goes.    Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Like, she's the first one to go. So I always apply.

Like, throughout the whole CUNY system, there are no funds, so there's no chance that you can get in.//   Art, I think art is very, I guess important. I see a lot of um, art in the sense of like dance, music, we have like, uh, a building just for like, the music department, like, it's pretty big, and there's like two places where they have performances, so I think art is very important. Um, there's a lot of photography classes. When I walk through campus, I see like, outs- the outside the, the glass, windows, whatever, there's a lot of things for pottery so, I think art is pretty important in Queens.

LAS1009,P086,School 1,Medium Importance,Seniors,"RATIONALE: MEDIUM IMPORTANCE: Medium is a bit of an assumption here. The participant actually only makes a couple direct mentions of money in the interview, saying that college was very expensive in Jamaica and that students today are opting for 2-year colleges to save money. BUT, the participant had to drop out in order to raise a family, and is commuting from Delaware now to preserve her credits, so it seems like money is a large factor. Medium seems like a good way to capture this given there is not enough to say high, and it seems like money is more than low for this participant.

Interviewee:  And fast forwarded to last semester where I re-enrolled again. (laughs). So, the reason why I even chose to go back to BMCC, because I tried other schools, because I actually don't live in New York anymore. I live in Delaware, but, um, all the schools would not take my credits-    Interviewer:  Mm.    Interviewee:  ... because the credits are old.    Interviewer:  Right.

Interviewee:	Um, I applied to Queens, I applied to some SUNY schools, um and I didn't get in to anything.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	To anywhere, um, and then I was interested in music industry, uh, maybe music business, recording technology. Um, I found a college, um, on Long Island, called Five Towns College and, um, they had a program that would have transitioned me. Like, it was another special ed program.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And that's probably how I got in. (laughs)   Interviewer:	Mmm.   Interviewee:	Um, and I was accepted, uh, but it was a private school. Um, and I went there for about a year and a half, because I did not want to go to Queensborough and, no ... and I got in, um, but from the day I went for my open house, I knew I, I didn't belong there. Like, that wasn't the right school for me, but I was just like very stubborn and, like, ""No, I'm going there.""   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, so I went there for about a year and a half and I commuted. I drove from, from Flushing, so it's like 45 minutes each way. I was working part-time in a store, in a supermarket. My grades were awful.   Interviewer:	Mmm.  Interviewee:	Um, I was just like young and stubborn and stupid and did all the wrong things.   Interviewer:	(laughs)   Interviewee:	In that college, I was involved in the music business club and in my first semester I was vice-president and then, um, I stayed vice-president for the year and then in my last semester ... there I was acting president, but, um, I, I resigned after a little while, 'cause I just wasn't, I wasn't into it.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Uh, and then, so that was 2005 to, um, about February 2006, maybe. Um ... I'm sorry, February 2007, I was there. And then I said, ""Okay, I need to get off my maybe ass. I need to go to community college, 'cause that's where I should be. So, I applied to Queensborough Community. I got in, but because mt grades were so low, they made me sit out the spring semester, to start in the fall semester. So that was Fall 2007. I went and, and at by then, I had a new job. I was working full-time in a construction [congress 00:05:30], administrative work. Um, and I was in school. I was taking, like, two classes. Um, and about half way through the first month, I was in a very major car accident. And I had to withdraw-   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And due to the absences, I lost my job and like everything stopped.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So, I didn't go back to school until 2010.   //  Interviewee:	Um, and I actually work at Queens College. And I've worked here since 2010 and that's what made it affordable for me to come back to school. Um, and I even proposed to the provost that they let me in conditionally, that I could take, um, three-credit math at Queens College and pass and they'd let me in, and they wouldn't let, they wouldn't do it. The provost agreed and the admission's director did not. So, I couldn't even get in. I'm like, ""I'm a 3.7. Let me in."" (laughs) And they're like, ""No. Your math is no good. We can't take you."" So I just, I struggled and struggled and then even in that period, I took a semester off and I pursued a certificate project management, and then came back to school and eventually got to Queens.  Interviewer:	Wow.   Interviewee:	And then part-time, ever since.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, I've always been part-time because I work full-time.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, CUNY pays for school. So it's affordable.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And in the last few semesters, I picked up your pace, taking three or four credits, uh, three or four classes at a time. So, finally, graduating in May. (laughs)   Interviewer:	Wow! Congratulations.  Interviewee:	Thank you.  Interviewer:	Um, okay, so I just want to make sure that I ... So at some point, while you were working at Queens, were ... did you also apply again and then were accepted? Is that correct?   Interviewee:	So, I had applied while I was working at Queens. I applied as a t-, again as a transfer and I was denied.   Interviewer:	Mmm.   Interviewee:	[inaudible 00:08:55] and I went to the director of transfer admissions and asked him what ... why I'm not going to get in, and they explained that it was my test scores on my proficiency exam.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And their requirement, there's a, there's a requirement for the test scores to be at a certain level for the senior colleges. At the junior colleges, it's a lower average, obviously, because it's a junior college. And he said, it just wasn't high enough to come in. It just wasn't.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	So, like, ""I understand you work here. I understand you're a 3.7. I understand you have everything else, but you have to have that.""  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And that one thing, um, they just, they wouldn't budge on it.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	And that's when I went for the provost's and the provost was very happy-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	He thought it was a great thing. We can make this work.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	I sought out the ... a math course for education, that was not, it was a non-algebra course, enter education students and I said, ""Let me take this course and then if I pass, let me in."" He thought it was great, but admissions did not. So, they just, they didn't take me. So, I had to wait till I passed the math at Queensborough and then right away, I came in.  //Interviewee:	Um, just one adjective, huh?  Interviewer:	(laughs)  Interviewee:	Um ... diverse.   Interviewer:	And why do you say that?   Interviewee:	Um, culturally, it is diverse. Um, but the, um, the mixture of students ... I've seen students that are 70. I've seen students that are 18. Um, veterans, um, mothers and fathers coming back to school, been out of school for a while. Um, and non-traditional, like me. Um, and everybody, everybody has a very unique path and a very unique story.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, especially as, from the perspective of somebody that works in student affairs-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Seeing a lot of students with a lot of challenges.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	You really get the sense, you really, you really get to see that this is not a college where there are students that are just, parents are paying for their education and they're going and they're getting it. These are students that ... I should even friends-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And they're working to help pay bills.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, they're fighting for their DACA, um, they're working three jobs to afford to go to school-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	Um, you know, um, th-there's and then there are those students that are just able to just go to school. Um, it's very mixed, very mixed.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And especially when I have the perspective of being a non-traditional student and knowing non-traditional students.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	I would say, diverse in that way.  //Interviewer:	Okay great. Um, all right. So what do you think that um, you should get out of your course of study at Queens? Do you think that there is certain types of knowledge or skills that everyone should have when they leave college?  Interviewee:	Um, I think that ... it's funny, you know, because when you're in high school, at least in T, in New York City, um, if you planners and they're like trying to help you like get organized. But they don't really teach you how.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, when you get to college, they kind of assume that you know how to handle your business. And there is still students that are like, ""Well my father filed my financial aid for me."" (laughs)  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And so um, there's an assumption that students have acquired certain life skills that they haven't.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And I think that, that's something that with the help of advising and other academic supports, students should be learning.  //Interviewer:	Sorry, what are the biggest concerns or worries on campus?  Interviewee:	Um, I really don't know.  Interviewer:	Okay.  Interviewee:	Like I said, students are very um, (laughs) they're not, they're not engaged. Um, we don't, they don't, they don't protest anything. They don't um, they don't come out, you know, as a collective. But I would say that in my conversations with my classmates, we talked about, you know, issues with DACA, Women's Rights, um, Trump.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, um, [inaudible 00:39:51]. Um, a lot of students are afraid to speak, especial- and I find that especially um, with students um, with more Muslim students. Some of them are afraid to, to voice um ... But the, but I do know that there are safe spaces where they're having these conversations.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	CERRU is one of those, is one of those organizations that creates those spaces.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Because that's part, part of their mission. And there are MSA Muslim Students Association, they have they're spaces. [inaudible 00:40:31] have their spaces for Jewish students. Like I know that people are having the conversations.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Um, we may not be having them together all the time, but I do know that they are having their conversations. Um, there are students that are concerned about budgets on campus. [inaudible 00:40:50]. So there's like [inaudible 00:40:53] clubs that are very focused on participatory budgeting."

Uh, okay, so why did you choose, um, BMCC over any of the other schools, uh, you might have applied to?

Interviewee:  So my, my major aviation, oh, my major is Aviation.    Interviewer:  Okay.    Interviewee:  So, uh, in order for me to get to that major, they required 5 courses. So I decided to, um, instead of me going to live in Long Island while, while I live in Brooklyn, so I decided way, why not have your first year in a college nearby you, so you could be able to get to know the college life before you like jump into Long Island, where you don't know anybody or have nobody around to help you out. // I would add a class that definitely teaches people about finance and how to like deal with their, with their financial life. Like something that would help them out financially. How to file taxes, how to, um, be financially successful, financially independent. That's a major class that needs to be added. // Interviewer:  Um, how is, um, what is ASAP, why is that helpful?    Interviewee:  ASAP, um, covers a, um, right, ASAP covers tuition.    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  If you receive financial aid, some, some, some people don't receive that much financial aid, and instead of them trying to pay it, uh, ASAP covers it and it also provides you with the textbooks you need.    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  And, uh, the most beneficial is the Metro Card 'cause most of the people live off campus or far from campus and they really need that Metro Card. So it saves a bunch of money. // Interviewer:  And why is over thinking the main issue?    Interviewee:  Because if I'm, if I'm gonna go to class, why would I be thinking of, ""Okay, my job is gonna be from"" ... like I start thinking about my long shift and then, ""Oh, my God, my pay sheet is not gonna be that good and I have based, bills to pay."" And a-, all of this just, you know, you know over thinking a lot of stuff that is, is not gonna happen now, so why are you thinking about, about it from now, when it's gonna happen like later on? So just focus on now and, you know, life al-, always finds a way, you know?    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. // Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). Um, and then, how do you normally spend your time outside of college?    Interviewee:  Well, it, uh, before work ... Like, now I'm working, so I'd only get to spend a mini time. So, uh, before work, I used to go to parks and museums. Um, as I said, I'm a nitu-, a nature freak, so I would go to like, like, I would see places online that are in New York, so I would strai-, straight up go to them.    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  So yeah, that was before work, but after work, no. (laughs) // I'll first ask them if they, um, if they work like late night because if they would do work late night, do not pick a morning class at all. That's an, that's an advice. // Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative). Um, do you have any peers that don't go to college and if so, do you see any difference between your experience and theirs?    Interviewee:  Yeah, I have, I have peers that do not go to college, but, um, I would say that they earn more money than me now.    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  But in the future, I don't think that that's gonna stay the same, you know?    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  That's the only difference that I know. And they, they, they're more free than I am. I'm more educated than them. Like, I, I, I know how to act like a smart ass sometimes. (laughs) And yeah, that's it. // Interviewee:  'Cause, I, I'm still thinking about, wait, what ... 'Cause I'm still having these thoughts about how my future will be if I pick Aviation. And Accounting seems more, more future independent than, uh, than Aviation does. Like I'll have a better career if I go to Accounting. And it's actually, uh, neither Accounting or Aviation are my real passion, but I know that my real passion is not gonna get me that enough money.    Interviewer:  Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:  So I gotta do something that gets me money that allows me to do my real passion.    Interviewer:  And what is your real passion.    Interviewee:  Um, I've always watched the people on National Geographic Wild, and the way they're so close to these animals and wildlife and all this stuff, it takes a long time to do what they're doing right now or to even earn these, these, um, the salaries they get or that money they do. So I would just do it for free, but, um, like, I, I would love to do that for free, but, uh, that's if I don't care about some, certain people in my life. But I do care about some certain people in my life, so I have to provide them with money. So even myself I could be able to go to safaris and these type, this type of stuff that allows me to be close to nature."

Um, and the biggest thing that, you know, had led me to pick it over other places was um, just the fact that they gave me a really big scholarship.    Interviewer:	Mm.

I think I applied to 10 ultimately and you know um, you know some rejected me um, some accepted me but didn't offer me any money.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

But, at the same time you know, I, I think that you know I have to remember you know, I speak from a place of privilege where you know, I was able to live on campus for you know three years and you know I had a lot of financial support from my parents and there are people at DePaul that are working full time jobs to make their college happen. Um, you know and there are people who just live you know, out in Timbuktu and you know it takes them an hour each way. Um, and so I think for people like that it's like yeah, you know we should ... Those things can be beneficial for people to be able to you know get a college degree to be able to kind of attain that, that uh, achievement or that, that status in life. You know with ...    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	With maybe less of the privilege that I had. // Interviewee:	Well, faculty would have the same number one as me I would think. Um ...    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	Yeah. You know I think that you know, especially a liberal arts faculty as opposed to like a maybe a business faculty. Um, would rank getting a job higher.

Um study content area because that's probably 'gonna be the area, your major's the area where you're going to end up working so you wanna' know as much about that as possible. And to learn to live independently, um I don't know. Um for me at least I was doing that before college so it wasn't really relevant or ...  Interviewer:	 No, that makes sense.

What advice would you have for them?  Interviewee:	Uh ... so you're saying that like let's say they majored in accounting and then the whole entire accounting field just disappeared?  Interviewer:	Yup. Hypothetically speaking.  Interviewee:	Um I would say, I mean it stinks, but you should probably try to go back to school and pick another  focus through study.

So I think if you’re going to go to college, you should at least do it to get a job, because if you’re just going to college coz you love history, you can go to the library for that.  Interviewer:	Mm.  Interviewee:	You don’t have to go to college. You’re going to college because you want to be a history teacher.  Interviewer:	Mm.  Interviewee:	You know?  //Interviewee:	I think probably people who come from other countries would feel the same way as like parents.  Interviewer:	Mm.  Interviewee:	Because that’s a lot … like that’s what a lot of people come here for.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Like, and that’s one big thing. I guess, like, if you’re from an immigrant household, that’s like a big thing. Like if you want to do something that, like, you really love and it doesn’t make a lot of money, it’s going to be like, “Why are you doing that?” like, “You know we didn’t come to America for that.”  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So yeah.  // Interviewee:	Um, liberal arts, um, I think that’s just like … It means that it’s … it has a focus. There’s a focus on, um, liberal arts education, which there is. I definitely can see why they say that, because they, they put a … they put a lot more money into, like, liberal arts than other programs, I think.  Interviewer:	And so what do you, uh, think about when you say a liberal arts education? What distinguishes that from other types of education?  Interviewee:	I think that’s what … That’s the type of education that makes you well-rounded in a sense, because you’re, you’re aware of, like, different things that are going on in the world.  Interviewer:	Mm.  Interviewee:	If, you know, if someone wants to talk to you about one thing, you can, you know, contribute to the conversation.

Um, well I know in like this hospitality class that I'm takin-, I'm taking we, they, um, they actually offer a lot of like, they have like an executive program for the caption programmers and that is quite good. Um, and I would probably do this if I could, if I wasn't working, but uh, also they've, they've, I've, they hooked, hooked me up with a interview with like the Hilton where I'm doing some event with a bunch of Hilton executives, just to like meet them, kind of like give me a job or anything, but I've, um, I mean, it could, but, uh, just things like that, um, that they offered a lot of those which is nice.  	Um, other things? I mean, they have the college fairs that, that seem good. Again, they're in the middle of the day so I like couldn't go, but they, they seem cool. Um, oh, what else? Oh, they have the NYU, um, uh, Scholarship thing to the Liberal Arts Program that is, uh, looks very good. I applied for it, but I don't think I got in because that was last year and I never heard back. But, uh, it's very like, uh, it's very hard to get into. But, uh-  Interviewer:	What, what is it?  Interviewee:	It's called the, it's called the NYU, the NYU Scholarship. It's called like the, the Gallentine or something. It's linked up with BMCC. Um, you have to have like super high grades and like, and have like As in all of your, in most classes. Um, it's, it's a li-, I forget, it's a scholarship that they have that they sent me e-mails about it once in a while, um, that's promoting it. Uh, um, what else? Um-  Interviewer:	And do you get into NYU if you get this?  Interviewee:	Yeah, it's like, yeah, basically.  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	It's, uh, yeah, yeah. Um, I don't know if it's like cheaper so I think you, they give you a scholarship, too, so that you, you don't have to pay as much.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	NY, NYU is pretty expensive.  Interviewer:	Hmm.  Interviewee:	Um, uh, they, they, they, I mean, they always e-mail me different things, you know, they send out like these Monday briefs. It's, they like, uh, it's like a e-mail they send every Monday and Thursday where they kind of lay out what's going on at the school so I've always, I'm aware of those things so I kind of read those and if I see something that's beneficial to me like I'll do it. But if it's a scholarship or something like I'll, I'll apply for it, but that kind of stuff. And that, that definitely helps."" // ""Interviewer:	Okay. Um, so, in general in thinking about your work and BMCC, is there anything that keeps you up at night?  Interviewee:	Um ... I mean, I definitely get anxiety about, you know, deadlines and stuff and that can effect how I sleep a little bit. Uh, um. Obviously my job is probably more, I, I get more anxiety from that just because if I screw up at my job I feel like the consequences are much higher than if I screw up in school because there's kind of, you know, not, I'm, like, if I screw up a, a, you know, a small mistake at my job could be a much bigger consequence whereas if I make a small mistake at BMCC where like I forget there's a quiz or something like that, like yeah, it's not quite the same stress as like losing my job and losing my income and losing my health insurance and all that kind of stuff, you know."" // ""Interviewer:	Okay, great. And then my last question unless you have anything else for me is: what motivated you or interested you to, in participating in this interview?  Interviewee:	Um, I mean, honestly, the $50 gift card (laughs).

I, you see a lot of kids, um, I mean, I say kids like they're a lot younger than me, they're not.

Because if you can just buy all your textbooks at once versus people who can't buy them for a month, then obviously, they're going to do better than you. I don't know.

Um, so, this is their first year doing it for finals week and I think it's pretty great because, um, not that I do it but um, so many students are taking advantage of that. I know one of my friends are doing it and they're-they're studying more, you know? They're not going to worry about their two hour commute.

Like, I mean, if I want to visit some of my friends who live across campus from me, then it’s a 20 minute walk or so but if I want to get to classes I can get there in 10 minutes, whereas, if I had to take a bus in or something every day or walk in from farther away or drive or whatever I ended up doing, that would possible take longer or be more expensive.  // 	I probably miss out on a lot of the social experiences that I’ve had – but at the same time those are not as necessary for me.

Probably, well, that auditing a class doesn’t cost anything and that figuring out what they want to do would make the most of their career, so figuring out what they would want to do and  that they find ways to – if you already know what a class is teaching, ask if you can skip it.  But those are probably mostly biased towards my experiences. // Interviewer:	And what do you think the people should do if they don’t know what they want to do?  What would be a better way of finding their passion instead of just picking majors and flip flopping around – what do you think would be a more helpful avenue for them to pursue?

Interviewee:	Um, I think that, especially at schools that cost about 60 or 70 thousand dollars a year, uh, you should really consider after high school whether you should go to college or not, and a lot of us don't. Uh, my parents told me that I didn't have to if I don't want to and I think now more and more people are convinced that they need a PhD to, to have success in life. And they go through [inaudible 00:10:14] like a social event that they have to go through, they pick a major and they don't always really think about ...  Interviewer:	Hello?

So I, I heard you say people are going through and picking a major and not always thinking ...  Interviewee:	Yeah, I think we're just kind of following the, the trails a lot of the time and not questioning whether we should keep going or not each time. And I think I, I asked myself whether I wanted to go to college and then I felt like I would learn a lot more by doing so. But I still believe that if I hadn't there a lot of things that, that I've learned much faster and making pos-possibly more mistakes but that's also why I think I would have learned much faster by entering the work force right away or going to West Africa right away if I didn't go to college.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	And so after four years and a lot of money spent I'm s-, I'm satisfied with my college experience but I still wouldn't say that, uh, it was better than not going to college.  // Interviewer:	Okay, that's really good to know. Okay, all right. And then my last question sort of in the academics realms is I want to hear about um, your thoughts on online learning or online education. So what parts of your education do you think could be done during online courses, and which maybe not?  Interviewee:	Well that's the thing, I think that when I say that ""Professors need to teach when they come to their class and not just lead class discussions"" is that I can read those books and go and talk about them or find it in a coffee shop, I don't have to pay the amount of money that I do to do that, if the professor's not going to add their ... their own expertise or classroom. And so I think uh ... I wouldn't encourage online learning, I would rather encourage better teaching. Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	But definitely when the better teaching is in there, online learning is a good option that's much cheaper and can oftentimes give the same results if the student is committed to actually doing the ... the online learning and reading. // Interviewer:	Okay, um, so some people say that college should be a transformative experience, and I want to know what you think about that statement, and if you agree.   Interviewee:	I mean, yeah I agree, I also think that if you went four years somewhere else, it would probably be a transformative experience as well. Uh, I would hope that with the investments that we make, you would see some changes, and I think it has been a transformative experience for me academically, socially as well. Uh ... but I don't think it has to be the best four years of your life, which is usually the other statement I hear a lot. Uh, I would hope that you'd have other great years after college, and maybe even before (laughs).  Interviewer:	Yeah. And thinking about, a little bit more about your own experience, how do you think you've been transformed throughout your time at Kenyon?  Interviewee:	Um ... well I mean, I think socially just living with roommates and being on the, on the, on a sports team always with teammates at very close proximity has changed things for me a little bit, when you're more used to, yeah, just living with your parents or in your own home. But also, uh ... socially like whether it's girlfriends that you have, or things like that, that's definitely transformative. Um ... and then obviously from an academic standpoint, I think that's the main reason why I'm happy I went college, because I do really feel like I've learned a lot.   	Um ... and so with all these reasons and just getting older, I think I have changed. But like I said, that happened in college, it could have happened somewhere else as well. Mine is the learning part, which is I think the main factor ... well, like the academic learning part.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)?

So it's like a lot of the people in the arts department, it's more of hobby, or they're doing it to learn how to teach, than actually like ""I'm gonna be an actor!"" or. // Interviewee:	I would say that the biggest thing, about college that I've learned is not where they want to go essentially, they go where they can afford. That's the biggest thing I've learned about the whole college process. And what I wish I knew before I applied to colleges so. I think that would be the biggest thing I'd say about college to someone who didn't know anything about it.  "

I, I think I applied to five schools total, um, and they were, Ohio State, Dayton, uh, Cincinnati, uh, Capital, which was ... is a small, like private school in Columbus, um, and then, uh, Notre Dame, and so I chose Ohio State just basically because, uh, of two factors, because of cost, uh, like affordability, and because its reputation.

I have a co-RA, but me and her are, uh ... we're in charge of a floor of about 55, uh, first ... mostly first, but a couple second year students, um, and many people basically just, like it's our responsibility is, um, to, uh, create a community on the floor, um, make it so it's not impersonable, like you don't know anyone on the floor, kinda make connections between people and make it a, a nice learning environment and just living environment, um-    ... but also around the buil- ... we're supposed to do that throughout the building and hold programs, um, events, and those can be like constructive programs where you invite a professor to talk about something like, um, contemporary gun laws or, you know, environmental standards in the US, anything you really want, or it can be as simple as like, having a floor program, like watching ... uh, just ordering food and having, you know, like a movie play or like a football game or something like that, um, and then also just like, obviously we have to deal with like discipline and stuff. Um, if, if we're like on call and we have like, things go wrong, we have to deal with like, the hall policies and things like that, but I think that's more of a, a minor part of my job just 'cause I live in a big building and we have a lot of RAs, so the time I actually spend like, having to patrol the halls and like, you know, enforce rules is very limited, but that's also part of it.    //[Great, and two final questions: What motivated or interested you to participate in that interview?]    Um, I think ... Well, like, obviously the incentive was the, the monetary incentive, but also, I think it was cool ... I think it's cool participating in research.

Some of them might not mean anything, but if it's some ... it turns out to be like a published study, I think it's kinda cool to participate in things like that, and then also, it said it was from Harvard, um, so I thought that was ... ma- ... that made it more influential than if it was for some ... a school that wasn't necessarily reputable.//"

I haven't looked at it in any bigger perspective because I see every little problem, or you know, as part of life, that's how I think it, so things that happen may be financially or mechanically. Right, their resources are great, everybody's good, but, personally, this finance problem, I think I see it as part of life and even everything that happens, whether my colleagues offend me or a professor offends me or whatever.

Um ... But yeah, also the 50 dollars is nice."" ""Um ... One other thing is that ... Kenyon has an interesting system of, kind of helping people who are ... Like I don't know, people who are on financial aid, but not helping so much with more people who are kind of in the middle or like above that, which I get. I mean, I'm on financial aid, so I appreciate it so much.    Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    For example, like when I studied abroad, they gave me back money, because I'm on financial aid.    Okay ...    But if someone pays full price to go to Kenyon, they don't get any money back. That money stays at Kenyon. So it's kind of like pretty weird system and a lot of people get really angry about it.    Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Personally, it works great for me, so I can't complain. But um, yeah, just kind of an interesting aspect about Kenyon. I'm not sure if other schools do that, but just like, if someone is on the edge of barely being able to afford full tuition at Kenyon, I mean, I can't imagine that it potentially made it difficult. Yeah, like ... also like because of my financial aid, I was able to apply to this really awesome program where they gave me a bunch of money to live in New York and do an internship in New York this summer.    Wow!    Um ... Yeah, and that's partly because I'm on financial aid, which so ... yeah. So I'm very, pretty [inaudible 00:47:09] of course, but um ... looking on the other side, some people would be a little frustrated by that.    Okay. And are people who are not on financial aid, are they really aware of the kind of opportunities that they don't have?    I don't know if they're aware of it.    Okay.    Um ... I mean, when they sent out the email and was offering money for an internship, I mean, I'm sure people saw that but um, they were like, ""Oh, well I'm not on financial aid so I can't even apply for this program."" People are definitely aware of the fact that they cannot get, that they don't get money back for studying abroad, but people on financial aid get money back. And I think the reason Kenyon does that is because it has been ... Like basically, the people who are paying full price, end up kinda paying for people with financial aid to study abroad?    Uhuh.    Um ... and I think Kenyon recognizes that if someone is on financial aid, they probably can't afford to like ... like studying abroad without working while they're abroad. It would've been the case for me. I wouldn't have been able to afford it, and so it was amazing having that extra- I got like, I think I got about 2,000 dollars back each semester. Get back to the living stipend that paid for everything, and paid for all my trips and paid for all my fare when I was abroad, so I am and I probably couldn't have done it without that."" "

Do you know why that is or-    Interviewee:  I really have no id-. I think it's because the summer courses are offered through the same college, which is this weird college within CSUN.

He has a strong awareness of the financial difficulties of those around him as well. He mentions homelessness as an issue that should be more of a focus at BMCC. He also discusses financial difficulties as having a gendered component and argues that young single men are overlooked for social services. He hints that his income is at or less than $10,000 a year and it is difficult not to wonder if he is sometimes speaking about himself when he is seemingly discussing the difficulties of others. // QUOTES ""Yeah, my number 2.

But if you're working and you have a, an income that they consider too large, which is not even that much, it's like 10,000.    Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Like (laughter), it's nothing.    Yeah.    And they say it's too large. That's ridiculous, but um, yeah. So, I, I feel bad for those people that work and they can't get the same resources.    Right.    You know.

And in what ways do you feel like the college experience, and- and this kinda goes off of what you were just saying, but how do you feel the college experience influence or help you grow as a person?  Interviewee:	You know, um, uh, one of the things that I like is you're able to ... I call it lobby. Um, just to go into other classes just to sit down ...  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And um, listen to the lectures. Um, without cost of the tuition. Um, and I think that in itself allows students to find which classes that they would rather take. Instead of reading or rate my professor, which one they prefer to take time, but just in having that freedom to search for classes in person and actually get a feel of what the course would be like, how does an individual shape themselves? 'Cause now they can find something that interests them or their passions. See the type of professor that can connect.            "

Do you think it’s important for all people to go to college now?    PARTICIPANT:   I think it depends on what they want to do.  Because you hear all these stories about these geniuses who dropped out of college.  So I don’t think college is for everybody.  So I wish – I don’t know, it depends on what job you want I guess.  But you can easily not have a degree.  Because I was thinking about anticipating your questions and what you guys were going to ask.  And I was just thinking that – and I think being a senior and becoming more cynical about all of this, you have to recognize – which at the time when I was a freshman I didn’t recognize this – that the university is a business and they make a lot of money off of us and a lot of money off of this stupid little piece of paper.  And yes, they teach you things.  But from a practical perspective, you could go and do a job, and the stuff I’ve learned in these classes – I think differently and I have a bigger perspective on the world, but that doesn’t necessarily help me day-to-day in a job.  They don’t teach you that.  So I could go to any job and learn how to do it and learn what they need from me with or without a college degree.

PARTICIPANT:   I knew if I didn’t do it now I – there was such a strong chance that I would never go again in my life.  And my parents had never been to Europe.  And it’s just that opportunity to travel relatively cheaply or the same as being in school was awesome.  So that’s why I wanted to do it.  And then also I’ve taken Spanish for so many years that I wanted that experience to live in a different culture and work on the language.    "" // ""So I know there are a lot of requirements here at Tufts.  How do you feel about having the number of requirements you have?  Do you feel like they are the right amount, too much, not enough?    PARTICIPANT:   I mean, they’re all very doable.  So the distribution requirements – so you have to do two math, two whatever.  I mean, they are like – it’s not too much.  It’s definitely not too much.  But then again, yes, they make you see things from different perspectives and make you more wholesome.  But again, if you were going to go to a job, nobody is going to care – like, day-to-day it’s not going to matter if you took that cal. class or if you did that art class or if you did – whatever.         And then Tufts has a residency requirement of eight semesters.  So this is what I was thinking, too, that this is the biggest – like, I don’t even know what to call it.  It’s messed up that they do this, because you have to be here for eight semesters.  So if you want to graduate a semester early or even be a part-time student – so next semester I only have a credit and a half left to do.  So I could easily be part-time, which means you take one or two classes.  But Tufts won’t – you have to get it approved by a dean, and they won’t do that unless you take a certain number of summer courses at Tufts.  So I have AP credits and I did a summer class closer to home when I was going into my freshman year over that summer when I still lived at home.  But that doesn’t count towards – they don’t count that.  So it’s kind of just – I just think of it as a money thing.  So it’s like yes, they’ll let you graduate early if they’ve already gotten enough of your money from before over the summer.  Which I think is really messed up that they do that.    INTERVIEWER:   Do you think that is really the motivation, is each student is X amount of dollars, keep them?    PARTICIPANT:   Yeah.  Just like policy-wise.  I’m sure they don’t think of it as individual on a case-by-case basis.  But that’s what it seems like.  What other reason do you have to keep me here?  You know?      INTERVIEWER:   And so if you didn’t have to stay here, how would things be different for your one-and-a-half credits that you have remaining?    PARTICIPANT:   Well, it would just save me money.  Because the tuition is like cut in half.  So you save a lot of money by being part-time or even graduating early.  That would save you a lot of money.  And then I would just start looking for jobs sooner and probably have been more proactive about that.  And then just start working earlier and just have less debt basically.  Because now I’m just filling up my schedule with stuff that I don’t really need.  You know?    "" // ""INTERVIEWER:   But that’s your instinct, and that counts.  So you can’t really learn from a computer.      PARTICIPANT:   Yeah.  And Tufts doesn’t let you do online courses as transfer credits.    INTERVIEWER:   That’s interesting.  Well, they also don’t let you transfer your –     PARTICIPANT:   I know.  They just want your money basically.

I have never met any of them, either.  I haven’t met any of them, but I’m just thinking about all of these people who make so much money and give money almost to make more.  You know?  And it’s just – do they even care what the students do?  They want the students to do well.  I would group the trustees in with the administrators.  "" // ""Do you think the students who graduate from here are different or lead different lives from students who went to other schools?    PARTICIPANT:   No, not really.  It’s too soon to tell, I guess.  Because I don’t have enough people to base this off of.  But kids who go to other schools, they still get jobs, good jobs, just as much as Tufts kids do.  I mean, so far the only thing I know about is the kids in finance are who do econ stuff.  They’re getting hired at JP Morgan, signing on for so much money.  And I haven’t heard about that at other schools yet.  But I don’t know if that’s just – I don’t know.  "" // ""All right.  If you were to give advice to an incoming freshman who is committed to coming here to Tufts, what three things would you tell him or more to make the most out of their time here?

And then, with that field, like, I don't know if I'd be able to move somewhere else with my degree, and just get ... I feel like it would have to be, like, a receptionist job, or something like that, where I know the pay wouldn't be equivalent to what I'm expecting to get.

You went to college by default. It wasn't something you sat down and made a decision about. But, I guess, thinking about it in general, do you think it's important to go to college?     18:53 S2: For anyone... In general?     18:54 S1: In general.    18:56 S2: Like a four-year liberal arts college?     18:59 S1: Sure. Yeah.    19:02 S2: On a philosophical level or sort of pragmatic level?     19:04 S1: Yeah. No, on a philosophical level. If somebody was to say, should people... Should I go to college or should I not go to college? What would you...    19:16 S2: I think it's necessary, but I think sometimes what gets overlooked is that it's really a luxury. Since so many people just don't have the access, haven't had the educational support up to that point to be able to succeed in that sort of four-year elite institution or anything like that. I think it would be nice if our society was less about, sort of... If you were still able to succeed doing something else that was equally respected, even if you don't have a liberal arts degree or whatever that isn't often related to real skills. I mean, I think you can learn to do and function and contribute just as much, if not more, by gonna... By just learning how to do something. I mean, I don't think necessarily a Philosophy degree would give you as much ability to take a job in society as like learning how to be a mechanic on a pragmatic level. And it would be nice if those positions were equally respected and that people who didn't have the same abilities or resources or access, could contribute to society in a way that isn't seen as the bottom of the hierarchy, kinda.    20:30 S2: So I think it shouldn't be so important. I think it should be available for people who can and want to, and will be able to gain something in productivity, however they define it, from that experience. But I wouldn't say everybody needs to go and get a liberal arts degree. I think there are other ways that people can learn to do a lot of the things those degrees are alloted for. Like, be open minded and all of that. I think a lot of people have real world experiences that expose them to different things. And college is like a great lab to sort of... For people to come together and like talk about those things, I guess, but maybe not experience them as much. I mean, college is more like a reflective space, but a lot of things are happening out there, out of that space, that could be equally fruitful in terms of development, growth and productivity.""    // ""Why they're important to me?

So, just tell me a little bit about how you see, like, why you put them where you did?     22:41 S2: Sure. So I put first, ""To study a particular content area in depth,"" because that's ultimately the unique thing about college that you couldn't necessarily do elsewhere. And that's really, I think, the benefit of it. If you want to learn to be an engineer you have to go and study that. If you want to be an academic in Philosophy, you have to go and study that. If you wanna go work for a non-profit, you don't necessarily have to go and study that. Except for that, now you really do to get that job even, just because it's a pre-requisite, which is why I put ""To get a job"" as number two just because that's the reality of it, in this country at least. I put as number three, ""To gain different perspectives on people, knowledge and the world,"" because I think college does foster an academic and a curious culture where that's really conducive to that. And that's kinda one of the nice almost luxury benefits of college.    23:34 S1: Yeah, sort of could be extra. Okay.    23:37 S2: Yeah. So it's like, Oh, if you get that I mean, that's great. I think it's an upper class or elitist vision that this is why you're spending, $200,000, you're spending to learn about different people in the world. I mean, it's a luxury. But it's something that does happen and in a unique way, in the college environment. And I put as number four, ""To learn to live independently."" Just having seen the perspective that in a lot of other countries that's not what it's about. And even here there's a lot of commuter schools, people who go to small local community colleges and that's not really something that's inherent to the college experience, that something that... To learn to live independently, it does happen and it's good, but I think there are other ways to mature. I don't think it necessarily makes you more mature. Even though you do have to get some of those skills down. I mean, there are still people who will have their mom call and wake them up every morning, instead of setting an alarm clock.

It's not about the money, you know, even if it's stupid, even if it's ... As long as it's something cool, we want to build it. It's something that we really enjoy and I- I feel that everybody here at Olin shares that- that passion. // Um, you know, when I think about it, I came to college to learn, but sometimes I wonder whether the stuff that I'm learning, I could've learned by myself. Um, and especially for- for my field, for the industry I wanted to get into ...    ... um, everything in software development, you can find online. And there's tons of free resources. Even those that are not free are a lot cheaper than college. (laughs) Overall.    Um, so ... sometimes I wonder whether I came to Olin just to get that degree because society, and um, most companies expect you to have a degree. But it ... you know, I'm not gonna ... you know, I'm not gonna bash Olin here, like, my experience at Olin [inaudible 00:06:50] be incredible. Um, the faculty is incredible, everybody here is amazing, but sometimes I wonder whether I could've done it myself paying less money, I guess. // [So uh, so what are your goals?]    Um, I want to be a software developer, um, at least within my career. Uh, I also like the data science career, but I've been mostly applying to software development jobs and will be most ... most likely taking a full-time job as a software developer.

It doesn't matter what industry it is, I'm interested in many different industries. And then probably go for an exit.

I just enjoy building things and if I can make money out of those, uh, that would be great. // Um, while maybe perhaps learning engineering, um, is- is more something that you need to learn from the books, business is something that you practice, that you ... that you do, and you sort of learn with practice and experience. So that- that sort of answers your question about like, for who? So Chris was telling me that really, like, if he didn't come to college, he would have been able to learn everything if he invested ... he- this is what he told me. If he invested his tuition money in launching different businesses, he would've learned a lot more than what he learned in Babson. // Um, it's probably harder for me because uh, uh, again, there's a lot of group projects and I gotta get to Olin every single time that there's a group project and all that. But it's also cheaper, um, college just doe- does charge you for convenience. Um, you know, and especially now, I share a room with my girlfriend, so like, in ... I'm paying a rent of $550 a month in Newton, which is one of the best places to live in. Um, so it's ... as opposed to Olin, where I would be paying more for a room. Um, so it's cheaper, uh, it's less convenient, just that. // Um, but ... honestly, I don't think people in Olin ... I think a lot of people at Olin have uh, concern with money sometimes. Because Olin is a school that you know, really goes far when uh, making their education available. So a lot of us have- get like free rides or half rides or things like that.

LASCAP 2398,P168,School 6,High Importance,Seniors,"HIGH: RATIONALE: Brings up finances often and meaningfully. As a returning student - sees ROI as important. // QUOTES: So I left, and then I got married when I was 26 so my husband started optometry School at OSU so we moved to Columbus. Um, and then I was supremely bored at my hourly job that had me working till 2am and I was frustrated and tired and under-paid and over-worked and I realized that it was about time to finish my education or else I was going to be tired, under-paid, over-worked and unappreciated for the rest of my life. // Um, I kind of got screwed on my financial aid package.    Which was really problematic. Obviously, you know, you need money to do things.    But um, it was, financial aid was like supremely un-helpful because they thought I was still working in New Jersey for some reason.    And they were like making me get so much documentation that I wasn't, that it wasn't reasonable. So yeah I had to apply for food stamps and stuff and then got denied because like I don't have enough dependents. It was just like a whole fiasco.    So it just typically, like the financial aid par that was really frustrating.    My medicines were costing like $500 a month at the time so it's just like, it was crap.    But that was my biggest problem, it got resolved and they've been incredibly generous with scholarships since then. // Um, that's an interesting question. I feel like especially since I come from a very educated family that I should think that everyone should also be very educated. But, I don't. I think that a lot of the problem with why college costs so much is because we put such a high value on whether or not you get an education. Like a four year degree, even if you get a job that doesn't require a four year degree right?    So all these people feel like they're obligated to spend, like, take out what, $40,000 in loans to make $30,000 when they graduate. It just, I feel like that doesn't really make any sense and sometimes it pays off a lot to go, you know, not higher education but sometimes it doesn't' and maybe we shouldn't be expecting everyone to do that. Because it can kind of screw up their lives afterwards.    Also education comes in many forms right? You don't have to matriculate at a local, you know, University nd get a diploma in order to gain skills and knowledge. And, I feel like, or like a lot of people assume that the only way to really get an education is to pursue higher education. // (laughs) so I had to take, they transferred my Princeton writing seminar which a lot of people think is like the hardest class to take at Princeton, they transferred it as an intro grammar class. Like, a remedial grammar class so I had to take an actual writing class. Which to me was incredibly frustrating because I just, I'm paying for school I don't want to pay for credits I don't need.    So that was frustrating, it was kind of a waste of my time. // Uh, that's, I knew I wanted to do that when I applied. I've thought about this recently when I decided to do that. Like I, I took some java classes in high school, I took- Oh I did a lot of computer music when I was a music major at Princeton. So I did do like a lot of coding when I was there. Um, my independent work was with a computer science professor who was cross-listed in music. So it wasn't that weird of a transition. But in general I felt like if I was going to go back to school on my own dime then maybe I should like get a deg- you know a degree that I thought would pay off really well if I wanted to go to work.    Also I like computers. I like bossing around something that's smarter than me. So that's always fun. // Sure, so getting a job. If you're not paying money for an education then hopefully you're going to get money out of it. Like I said you can educate yourself for free in different ways, your payment [inaudible 00:42:46].

You don't wanna, I don't think anybody wants to waste any time, money, um, and stress on classes he doesn't need to take. Um, so that would be, you know, take a piece of paper and make a chart of which classes you need to take to get to the majors that you might be interested in.   	And then the third thing would be, um, would be to uh, to always ask questions at class, you know, a teacher, it could be a teacher just doesn't call on [inaudible 00:46:26] doesn't, just, you know, a teacher might just, might not ask anybody if they have any questions.

How was that transition or you?]    So that was, that was a bit different. That was way, way bigger.    Because I hadn’t moved out at home before and this was my first time moving out.    And to come out and find my own apartment and I mean pretty much new everything and, um, it was, it was hard at first just mostly ‘cause I didn’t know how to click anything and I was struggling to make ends (laughs)    And, um, but other than that I was really comfortable moving here. I kind of, I was happy with the decision. I knew what I had to do so came out here, met people and, and it got way easier as time went on but-// [Sorry, I should have broke it down. So what do you think are some of the benefits of living on a college campus?]    Okay, well just the immediate obvious one, you’re, you’re obviously closer. You don’t have to spend money on commuting or anything like that. Um, you really no excuse to be late to class.// [Okay. And then what do you think are some of the benefits of commuting to campus?]    Uh, well you save a whole lot of money.    My favorite ‘cause doming is expensive.

That’s the reason I’m, I wouldn’t, I’m not living there.// And I, like in my most stressful time when I was here, like I had a million things to do and then I got home from work and my laptop broke and I was just like a mess and then I just called my mom and …    That helped. So like, well she sent money for the new laptop but, just still, just still talking to her, it felt-    She calmed me down and it made me feel way better.// Um, it sounds kind of lame but I work at the map library where we have … Because we have a collection of just tens of thousands of maps.

She always just sends me money without asking. So I kind of just want to start working to send her money back.    Not like … You know, like she sends it.

Sometimes you know, just … I don’t know, there’s people that go to school for different reasons, but you’re like … Most of us right now are here to like get a job.    [Yeah. Um, and then what do you think faculty would say about this question?]    Um, probably either to get a job also or to study a particular content area in-depth. But I feel that they would say that because that’s what they would want to believe. That you know, students that go to college it’s because they’re passionate about that subject. And you know, that’s obviously a good thought but now I’m just speaking personally for me, what it comes down to is that I need to get a job and make money in the end but-    At the same time I, I do find teachers understanding that so probably between those two.// [Yeah, absolutely. Okay, um, so in thinking about your work and this school, what kinds of things may keep you up at night?] Um, but if anything, probably bills. But I’m … Again; I’m the type of person to make sure that there’s always enough for that, but-    Sometimes you, you’re not 100% sure if you know, this payment is gonna be on time or if it’s not and that could, that could [inaudible 00:58:47]// [Yeah, great.

And then during the summer I worked as an administrative assistant in Queens Library and again those weekly meetings, I mean monthly meetings helped us ... helped me deal with my manager when things are getting a little chaotic. // Interviewee:	Um, one of the pros is a financial aspect cause I can't afford to have a vehicle or maintain a vehicle so just being able to commute really saves me the money even though MetroCard is not cheap.

And we have our own activities that we do, like if we have pride day and stuff like that, you know, that you're always invited even if you don't really want to go. // Interviewee:	Biggest problems, hmm, I think one of the problems is because since only buses reach our school, like, a lot of the times we're, um, I would forget to fill my MetroCard at Main Street for example, or whatever side you're coming from, I would be stuck at school because I couldn't get back home. I didn't have money on my MetroCard. We don't those, um, to refill our cards, those machines.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	So you're kind of isolated-   Interviewer:	Right.   Interviewee:	-from the rest of the borough, so that was a problem. Yeah, that's the main one I can only think of at the moment. // Interviewee:	Uh, I would spend it in the dining hall (laughs), so just eat there. I think mainly that stems from like, oh no I can't afford to eat at school today, I have to go home. So just having that open for the whole week would be awesome. // Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- Okay. So along those lines, do you think it's important to take risks while you're at college?

That's why, like, I am going to college. I can't risk not going to college.

We came to Ohio, [inaudible 00:02:03] and um, and visited the University of Pittsburgh, um, the few that are kind of small colleges.

Most of the school is like, as I told you ... it's like, rich, white kids and stuff-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Interviewee:	- and I don't know much about like this whole, like black, white and stuff. Like minorities ... like stuff here ...  Interviewer:	Uh huh.  Interviewee:	So I think, for me it's like, like I don't think that affected me like in any way. But I do- You can like really see it in the ... black students here. Like they only hang out with like, their ... like few, like black friends.  	Like, they have their spot and they like, they're not involved with like ... they're not involved much with like other students and stuff. And I think that's like kind of a problem.

Alright and so then I'm also wondering if you feel like students themselves feel empowered to work on any of these problems or solve them if they see them on campus?  Interviewee:	Um ... yeah. 'Cause like, last semester, there was like this, uh ... I have a friend, who's from Columbus, Ohio, but he's originally from uh I think, France, and like his parents are from Guinea. And so this other student, he's like white he called him the n-word, so ... the whole school, like the whole black student's union were like, they were having uh ... they were protesting the school to do like something.  	Because like the school didn't do anything about like the kid ...  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	So, like, even like every, every student was like protesting.

Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	So I think students here are like empowered.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative).  	That's ... that's a positive story, I think. Um. How did that make you feel as an international student? Did you, did you feel like that helped to solve the problem or at least kind of change people's feelings about it at all?  Interviewee:	Yeah I think it's, it showed how like that students can-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	- achieve anything if they want it.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	Because like, they like- just bold, like the kid was insulted who was abused, was like, he was my friend.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	So, the kid, the other kid was like a lacrosse player, and like he called him like the ... he called him the word first.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	He was kind of drunk. And like, he was like with his friends. And they told him, it's like ... the kid's name is Mahamadou, so they called him like, it's Mahamoudu ""It's fine, he's a bro"".  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	But he like still called him like the word again, like three times or four times.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	And like, he went to like the administration and like told them, but like the administration they don't do anything about it.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	Because like, I suppose like, I think his parents contributed like a lot to the school. Like, in terms of like, money and stuff.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	So ... But, but then like he told the uh Black Student Union, like the men of color, we have [inaudible 00:30:42] here. So, he told our group. So then like everyone started posting on Instagram, Facebook, like throughout the school. Like in the dining hall, there was like this huge protest. Like everyone was like just sitting there, doing nothing.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)  Interviewee:	Like just silent protesting. And given that the school's president was like there, so I think like he heard that.  //  So if I were to give this same list that I just gave you with the four choices to other students at Kenyon, I'm wondering if you think they would, um, agree with how you ranked those items or if you think they would think differently about that list?

I guess, like you're a bit more into, like, like, the everyday world-  	... Than you were, like, as opposed to, like, in high school where it was more, like, closed off, and, like, sheltered.  	I mean it still, like, gives you some kind of, like, shelter so to speak, but you're also, like, paying for college here and there. You might be seeing things more.  Like, you feel, like, not alone. Like, parents, and stuff like that. You wouldn't see that really in high school. So- like, you see it a little bit in high school, but not really.  // Interviewee:	Um, well for me, um, well I was, like, brought up in a home where, like, um, you kind of need to learn independence, cause, like, I don't come from, like, such a, like, wealthy home.

Everybody has, like, their own opinions. Um, like, someone in my neighborhood might say, like, get a job is the most important.     	And, like, knowledge, and, like, perspective are things that are least important, just cause, like, I know, um, like, how the people here grow up and how they more or less think.  	Um, I don't know.

She's just working.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm.  Interviewee:	So, like, she does have more time to just kind of do whatever she wants, or she has, like, like extra money that she can, like, go on vacation or something.  // Interviewer:	Okay.

LAS0211,P034,School 6,High Importance,Seniors,"RATIONALE: HIGH IMPORTANCE: While the participant makes a couple references to direct financial need (the gift card, and choosing OSU because it gave the most money), I have primarily selected this as high because the need to get a good job and make money after college deeply shapes her view of the college experience--what is valuable to study and the importance of getting internships.

So, I knew that I wanted an environment where people were [happy 00:01:00] to be there, um, loved the school, support in each other ... So, I looked into a lot of, like, state schools and, um, it was the [month 00:01:10] that I got into Ohio State and [inaudible 00:01:11] that school, and they offered me the most money and I got to the honors college, so ...

Um, and overall, do you think it's important to go to college?    Interviewee:  I think that if you want to do anything with your life it's necessary. I don't if that's a good or bad thing but I think it's a fact of our society right now.    Interviewer:  Uh, can you say a little bit more about that?    Interviewee:  I mean ... Right now, I know people who need to get master's or highers degrees just to be above an ... An associate at their career- Like in their careers, so ... We're in a very education heavy society right now, um ... A lot of people are accumulating debt and degrees that they don't necessarily need.

826,P007,School 9,High Importance,Seniors,"HIGH IMPORTANCE: RATIONALE: Finances are a consistent preoccupation - the participant mentions repeatedly that her parents are helping to pay for college so she feels like she needs to do well, and complains quite a bit about the cost of college. She is concerned about where her money is going and views college as a major financial investment. // QUOTES: And I guess in fun life – I did like living in the dorms when I lived in the dorms.  And I feel like – at least the people that I’m friends with, I feel like education – maybe ‘cause we’re in college, obviously, and we’re paying money – but I feel like the people that I hang around with, we value education and value getting good grades and stuff.  And I don’t think that’s necessarily the case for some colleges, speaking from stories I’ve heard from my friends. // Interviewee:	Yeah.  I definitely went out a lot my freshman and sophomore year.  And I didn’t feel like it got in the way of my academics because – my parents pay for school, so it was always kinda the understanding that if you’re coming down to school, you’re gonna – you’re gonna do well.  And I like to do well for my own personal benefit.  So I did go out a lot and – but I didn’t feel like it – school was always my first priority, but if I had time, I would go out.  // Interviewee:	I think there needs to be some changes with the price.  I think it puts a lot of pressure on people.  I am lucky enough my parents pay for my school, so I’m gonna be debt free.  But I think the whole college as an institution needs to figure out some way to change it.  And I think – I think that’s the biggest thing.      I don’t know how I would fix it.  I’m not the dean, so I don’t know how I would fix it.  But I think it’s really – and today, I had to pay $2,000 to take a three-week class over J-term.  And things like that – that I’m taking – it’s three weeks and it’s gonna be $2,000 and things like that, really – that’s probably my biggest complaint. // Interviewee:	If – when I walk around and I see the same people leaf blowing the same thing.  We pay these people to blow leaves all around campus.  Can’t we just do it once?  I don’t care if there are leaves there and we’re – things like that, that I’m like, “Why do we pay for this?”  And I think – that’s just a stupid example I saw when I was walking here.      But there’s all kinds of stuff that goes on that I’m just like, “Why are we – why are we doing this instead of just focusing on getting us through school and getting us outta here?”  I would rather be in the ugliest buildings ever than have to pay what I’m paying now.  But it comes hand in hand with getting people.  I understand it, but it makes me mad. // Interviewee:	Yes and no.  I think – I’m an interesting person to ask about this, ‘cause I have opinions about that.    Interviewer:	That’s good.  We want opinions about ____.     Interviewee:	I think – I’m one of the only people in my family to go to college, and I think that if you don’t know what you want to do, you shouldn’t go to college because it’s so expensive.  And I knew coming into college what I wanted to do, or had a good idea of what I wanted to do.  And so I think for me, yes, it was useful.  But I think for a lotta people, they can be successful without college.  And I’m a first generation college, and my parents are very successful.  And so I think – I think it can be important to go to college, but I don’t think it necessarily is vital to lifelong success. // And then obviously, you need to make money somehow, so to get a job.  If I could just learn for the rest of my life, I would.  But I can’t, so I’m gonna teach.  And I think it would be a disservice to pay this money to not try and get a job.  And to learn to live independently, I think, is also really important.  And I wouldn’t say by any means I’m independent yet, but hopefully at some point I will be. // Interviewee:	I think I fall somewhere right in the middle.  I feel like sending people to college to just free-fall around and do whatever they want – I think – I think in order to be successful, you need to be able to figure out the easiest way to be the most successful.  And I think if there was no prescribed classes, people would just take the easiest ones that they could, like making babies and wine tasting and – I have another roommate that’s taken every single easy class this campus has to offer, and she’s running out of them now.  And I think that’s almost a disservice to pay this much – I keep going back to this – but to pay this much money to just learn things that obviously give you life experience, but I don’t think they necessary make you more successful in life.  But if it gives you credit, then why not?  "
LASCAP2430,P078,School 2,Medium Importance,Seniors,"MEDIUM IMPORTANCE: RATIONALE: The participant attended CSUN over another school because of financial aid, talks about needing to work to help her parents after she graduates, and a few other brief mentions of money. // QUOTES: Um, well ... To start with, it wasn't my first choice. I was trying to go to Cal State LA. However, it was mostly financial aid at the time of like where I was gonna be able ... Cause I couldn't like ... My parents couldn't help me to pay for college, so I was in the ... I was accepted to both, but it really just down came to financial aid.// Um ... Basically time. Mostly time, because I kind of wanted to graduate within four to five years so I can start working and, you know, helping out my parents mostly. So that kind of has motivated me to do well in school.// However, you do save money, which dorming can be very expensive. And then, not talking about food expenses that you have to do, meal plans that you to buy if you're on campus, so that's kind of money you save in a sense if you're living off campus.// [So what would you see if the job students are training for disappears in the future?]    Um, if it disappears, I would think college would not be something very important.    Or, at least something people would spend their time and money ... If it's not gonna get them into a job where they want or a career.  // I think they would view it somewhat similar. I mean, there might be differences because there's always the issue of, like, yes, you'll be learning a lot, but the thing is sometimes people don't have the time and resources to spend, you know, their time learning things if it's not gonna help them, you know, in their job career.    So that might be something they might argue against, but my thing is, you know, if they're not helping you, people sometimes don't have these kinds of resources.    To gain knowledge. Sometimes people just go straight to work after high school, and they make money.  //"

I just don't see why you would really pay this much money if it's not gonna pay off in the future. I think that the second most important would be learning to live independently because otherwise, that's not really like a...

Interviewee:	Two years.  // Interviewer:	Yeah, different classes. Perfect. Um, and do you think in general it is important to go to college?  Interviewee:	Um, yeah I think so.   Interviewer:	Why, why do you think that?  Interviewee:	Um, I feel like it could give you, even if you don't desire to do what you wanna do, um, for your degree, I feel like it's always something that you have that you could have, work off of like at your masters or something you know. Um, always have that as a backup.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). I, so sorry to keep doing this but I, do you, are you holding over the microphone or something at the moment potentially?

Interviewer:	Yeah I see, so you're current, you're working?  Interviewee:	Yeah.  Interviewer:	In addition to studying, okay. How many hours a week do you work?  Interviewee:	Um, it depends, sometimes I, might work like 20, 20 to 30.  Interviewer:	Oh wow, okay.  Interviewee:	I work maybe 24.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Um, and could you again, just quickly let me know why you decided to write them like that? So, to learn to live independently, why is that the most reason for you?  Interviewee:	Um, I think it's the most important because, um, you never know what could happen.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So, I feel like you could be married, right?  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	... and get a divorce and then, um, you know, all you did was be a stay-at-home Mom and, or have like a, like a job that pays you minimum wage or little bit more above that, and then you, you may be stuck in a marriage that you're not happy with, only because you know, that person is your, your, your, your, you know, the person who's holding, like who's holding the roof over your head.  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	So, I feel like it could work male or female, not just female, but, um, that's one of the reasons why I feel like, you know, if something ever goes, goes wrong-  Interviewer:	Mmm.  Interviewee:	... with the, with the family you built, it's just something that you have to be like this, you know, ""I could separate from you and I don't have to be with you no more."" So, I think that's important. Also, too, if you never get married and you know, you're living with your parents, you know, one day they're going to leave too, 'cause it just happens, it, it's like, death, death is something that happens. They could die. (laughs) And then you're just left to fend for yourself.  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	So I feel like it's never get the sense to like, you know, get something for yourself-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	... it just will, you'll never really learn, you'll never really be able to be okay, to be alone, if you don't have, like, a college education. That's what I think.  Interviewer:	Yeah, yeah that's great. Thanks for explaining that.  Interviewee:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). And then, taking a different perspective, I put because you don't, you could, you could be, you could know that you want to go to college, but you don't know exactly what you want to do yet.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So, I feel like college is somewhere where you'll definitely learn within maybe a year or two, something, or something that you're interested in, just from taking your regular liberal arts classes or something. You'll be able to find the, an interest-  Interviewer:	Mmm.   Interviewee:	And then, three, I put, to study an area in more depth, because you know, you could be really into psychology, and want to get your doctorate in psychology and then you'll be an expert. And then, um, same thing with getting your master's or anything-  Interviewer:	Mmm.  Interviewee:	... you could build off of what you gained. And then four, I put, to get a job, because you could get a job without a college education-  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).   Interviewee:	... you know, it might not be, like, the best-paying job, perhaps, but you could still get a job.   Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	So that's why I put that, four.   "

Interviewee:	I would say definitely yes.    Interviewer:	And why?    Interviewee:	I think with the way that the world is these days it’s like unfortunately having a college education is becoming like having a high school education: even like graduating from college with a BA or whatever – BS – like a lot of the times you’re still under qualified for so many positions, so I think it’s jut a matter of like putting yourself in the best circumstances possible, and it’s unfortunate that it’s so expensive but I think that’s just kind of like the way that the world is progressing and just like put yourself in an equal opportunity to get ahead in life I think is a necessary stepping stone. // And I would say to remember that you’re in college and you are here to get an education and in the long run if your parents are paying for college don’t waste their money by just partying the entire time because you are here to learn something and hopefully you’re having a good time as well, but just to like remember you are here to actually take some classes. // "

I went with high because money seems to be a theme throughout - something the participant is concerned with now (buying a car, having a job), and in the future (influencing his career/professional decisions). // QUOTES: Interviewer:	Okay. Um ... and so how did you pick Queens College?  Interviewee:	Well I got in ... I applied to about three other colleges, I got into two of them. But the only thing was they were private colleges. I got some scholarships but it wasn't enough for me, it was too expensive. And one of my friends told me that Queens College was kind of an on site admission. So I just walked over there from school, actually, my high school was right there, literally on the other side. // Interviewee:	So I just walked over there one day after I got done and ... they looked at my SAT scores, they looked at my GPA, and they said that I was in.  Interviewer:	Oh, okay.  Interviewee:	So ... and it ... it was affordable for me, and I liked the campus, I thought it was ... I heard that it had good ratings, too. Like there was something in the Washington Post that said it's a really good bang for the buck. So that just persuaded me to go there.  // Interviewer:	Uh huh. Okay. Okay ... um ... so you said accounting and business was something that interested you. What did you choose to major in?  Interviewee:	I'm majoring in accounting and economics right now.   Interviewer:	Okay. And how did you decide upon ... you said accounting was something you were looking for, how did you make the transition from science research to accounting?  Interviewee:	I was always more business oriented from the start. In my younger years I was more science oriented, but, uh ... throughout high school I started developing an interest in business because, um, I guess the culture around me was all about money, and stuff, you know, like hip-hop music. They're all rapping about money. And then I had a lot of friends, [inaudible 00:06:27]. They'd come from a business family, um, it seemed very professional to me. I think that's the path that I wanted to go down. Um, even when I was looking into nursing I was kinda only looking at it for the path to the money because I always had goals of starting my own business. So I don't ... I don't know if there was ... the transition wasn't very hard for me.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	It was straight forward, it was just what I was interested in.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	I think even if I was in science I would still be looking at the business aspect of it.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	So I don't know if you'd really call me a scientist.  Interviewer:	Okay. Uh, yeah. And is there a particular business, or idea, that you're interested in pursuing? Or is it just the idea of business that you like?  Interviewee:	Well at first it was just the idea of business, but as things went on ... and at this point in time, [inaudible 00:07:20] I'm looking to start a consulting practice where I give clients advice about their personal and their business finances. That's my current goal.   Interviewer:	Okay. Um ... great. And, um, why did you decide to dual major? With accounting and economics?   Interviewee:	Well I'm working for my ... year down 150 credit requirement.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	Um, I also thought it would look good: the extra economic degree. And I was interested in it from the start. Um ... yeah, the extra major could help me pick up some more credits.  Interviewer:	Okay.  Interviewee:	And in some [inaudible 00:08:01] ways to look at it, aside from the accounts- accounts perspective. Is another reason, it's not just for the credits.  Interviewer:	And can you describe that a little bit? What are some different ways that you see looking at things because of that, because of your economics?  Interviewee:	Well, I was ... I would put it this way: accounting is just accounts. There's a thing ... Accounting I look at it as a more formal organization. Because you're just determining how much goes where. But economics is more theory based. Accounting has theory, but they're more like rules. Economics is like this goes up, this goes down, and it also looks at behavior. I think, in that aspect, you can apply in different ways. Accounting is just ... they're both freeform, but accounting is just more, I don't know, regulated, I guess.  // Interviewer:	Okay. Alright, great. Um, and do you remember; what was your transition like to college from high school? Is there anything that you found surprising or for maybe which you were not prepared?  Interviewee:	Yeah, it was actually very difficult coming from high school where I was like, I was basically like a king in high school, and I knew everybody. So hanging out all the time, everything was so easy, the professors, I mean the teachers, they were ... they cut you a lot of slack. And coming into college I was just less motivated at first. I really didn't care to come to school cause it became very tough, like ... even just to make friends it became very tough. And then, on top of that, everybody just ... they were focused on their own fight, their own development. Whereas I came in, I was kinda more focused on having a good time in the beginning. But it wasn't like that for some other people.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	So that was the most difficult thing for me.  Interviewer:	Okay. And, um, you say, at the beginning, do you feel like your focus has changed to now?  Interviewee:	Do I what?  Interviewer:	You said you were focused more on having a good time at the beginning. Do you think that your perspective has changed now?  Interviewee:	My perspective has changed. Well, my perspective hasn't changed. I think it's my definition of what a good time is, kinda has changed. That's the main thing.  Interviewer:	So how do you see it now?  Interviewee:	I find a good time being ... as being stable, and like, being able to go out when you know you're good. I don't ... before I was just looking at something that was more empty just, like, hanging out without really having any stability in life.  Interviewer:	Okay.   Interviewee:	And there was the transition aspect, of there came a point where really it started getting to me and eventually I wasn't having a good time hanging out. Because I didn't feel stable in life.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh. And so what makes you feel stable?  Interviewee:	Um, being able to do what I need to to get done. Being able to have time, make time for the people that I want time for, have a stable job, be able to sustain the household eventually. But right now I'm looking to be able to get a car, and be able to pay that good. Um, I think I've reached a higher point of stability now because I'm reducing my credit card debt, and I'm actually staying on track with the payments and everything. And I'm also attending classes regularly, my grades have gone up a little bit from before.  Interviewer:	Okay.  Interviewee:	And I also fell, um, I feel more comfortable ... even with talking to other students.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	So I look at all of that as stability.  // Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. And, um, just out of curiosity, what is your schedule like on an average day? How often are you at Queens in a week, and do you stay all day? Or do you go back and forth.

Interviewee:	I'm a junior accountant, and a junior tax consultant during the tax season. // Interviewer:	Okay, great, um, how bout ... can you tell me about some particular courses that you've taken that you've really enjoyed, or that you consider to be time well spent? Or, and then courses that you feel like that have been wastes of time?  Interviewee:	Yeah, I think accounting 101 was actually the best. It was just ... It was nice, learning all the concepts for the first time and everything, and that actually clicked well with me. Uh ... courses that I didn't ... I haven't been, I think all my courses were ... pretty well spent, even the gen-ed courses. I can't really think of a course where I've wasted my time.  Interviewer:	Okay.  Interviewee:	Even in drama I didn't ... drama was interesting too. I think that was like the, you know, most time-passing course that I'd taken. But, yeah, it was interesting. We were in ... we read some literature, we acted out in that class. I don't know if I would pay to do that, though. That- that's the only thing. I don't know how I feel about paying for that.  Interviewer:	You don't know if you were what?  Interviewee:	I don't know how I feel about paying to take a course like drama.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh.  Interviewee:	That's the thing. So it would all be in terms of gen-ed, where I feel like I wasted time. Or maybe, like ... I wanna say English, but at the same time I think English is necessary with all the essays and stuff. But, um, what I learned in English I didn't learn from courses in college. It's just looking back at high school. So ... I don't know. That's all I can say, I don't want to say that English was a waste of time.  // "
2026,P058,School 8,High Importance,Seniors,"HIGH IMPORTANCE - RATIONALE: He decided to attend Tufts because of the aid package (along with reputation), mentions that college can help you get a well paying job, and was able to study abroad because of the financial structure. //    QUOTES: Interviewer:	Great.  So when it was your turn to think about attending college, what let you to your interest in Tufts and ultimately to decide that it was the right place for you?    Interviewee:	Well, I looked at Tufts, I just was looking for a school that had a solid academic reputation.  I, myself, was at the top of my class in high school, and I was looking for a school that wasn’t that far away from home.  And I—the schools I got into really ultimately  decided this decision between a school that I actually got into was one, the ___ listed how close Tufts was and its academic reputation, to financial aid package from Tufts was significantly more generous than some other colleges.    Interviewer:	That makes a huge difference.    Interviewee:	Yeah, definitely.    Interviewer:	Tell me, would you mind sharing what the other school was that you sort of had narrowed it down to as option B?    Interviewee:	Mm-hm.  I had—it really came down to I had gotten into Tufts as well as BU, and they had an experimental Honors Program that year at BU.  I’m not sure whatever happened to that, but I had gotten a pretty similar amount of aid between Tufts and BU, but in the end, I chose Tufts because really of its academic reputation, being a little more prestigious than BU, and I wasn’t sure what the Honor’s Program really had in store for me.    Interviewer:	Sure.  It’s hard to be in the guinea pig year when they’re just starting up.  That makes a lot of sense.  In terms of the educational program at Tufts, is there anything that was distinctive about that that helped you make your decision?    Interviewee:	Particularly in the educational program, not a whole lot in particular.  I think at the time I was looking at schools that were really good—had a good program for International Relations.  So what was—drew me to Tufts from that perspective, was close ties to the Fletcher School, and potential path leading to International Relations.  All in all, it was more strong academic reputation that Tufts has in general that I had heard from reading online reviews that the classes are top notch and would be just as good anywhere.  //  Interviewer:	All right.  Do you think it’s important for people to go to college?    Interviewee:	In general, yes.  I think that in this day and age, it’s not like the use of ____ people need to go to college if they want to get—if they want to secure a decent career.  I don’t think that’s always the case though.  I have tons ____ friends who have decent careers being—some of them are electricians.  Some of them work at installing cable.  They make decent money, but I think for most people, going to college is the easiest way to secure a job.    //  Interviewer:	So you said that you studied abroad in Spain.  Is that something going in that you knew you would want to do is study abroad in general?    Interviewee:	Yeah.  I definitely—when I went to college, I wanted to study abroad, and what I think—that was another thing.  It wasn’t so much such a deciding factor making me to go to Tufts, but Tufts makes it really easy, because they have access to their own Tufts programs abroad, which is what I did.  I did the Tufts in Spain program.  But what was so attractive to me about that program was financial aid, because it’s technically Tufts University in Spain.  It completely transferred over, so I didn’t have to worry about having to pay extra to study abroad.  It was as if I were taking a semester in Medford, but instead, I was halfway across the world for the same price virtually.  So, it was a huge incentive.  Especially, I just looked at my degree requirements, I discovered there was nothing I really—I wouldn’t be hindered to graduating on time by doing it.  So I just thought, why not?  It seemed like a pretty good idea.    Interviewer:	Yeah.  That’s amazing that it’s—that the financial aid sort of travels with you like that.    Interviewee:	Yeah, I was really fortunate about that.    Interviewer:	Is that something that you learned and it was a surprise?  Or is that something they pitched on the tour, and you knew going in that that was going to open up that opportunity?    Interviewee:	I think I understood it, because I was looking at studying abroad opportunities before I actually accepted the application to any colleges.  But and I think I did know that about Tufts before I went in.  I don’t remember them necessarily advertising it, but certainly by my sophomore year, they were advertising it.  For other students who didn’t have financial aid, I suppose it didn’t really make a difference for them what program you did.  But for me, definitely it made a huge impact on my decision to go abroad.  And I think it could have made an impact on my decision to go to Tufts, because it made it such an easy option.    Interviewer:	Do you think if the financial aid hadn’t transferred, you wouldn’t have done the semester abroad, and had that rich experience?    Interviewee:	Definitely.  I would not have gone abroad if I didn’t have at least some form of financial aid.  Being around $25,000 or more, whatever it is per semester standard rate, I don’t think I would have done it.  Even if there were cheaper programs, without an aid package, it would have been too difficult for me to pull up.  So, luckily I don’t—I didn’t really have to look into other options that much.  So I was pretty satisfied with the Tufts program, but it would have definitely made it a lot more difficult and probably would not have happened.  //  Interviewer:	What about trustees of the university?  What do you think they would say the goal of the college education is?    Interviewee:	To make money.    Interviewer:	Fair enough.      Interviewee:	I think that’s probably it.  I don’t know much about the trustees, but I know that I write all my checks to them.  That’s what I’d say about it.  //  "

He doesn't want to waste any time on something that won't produce a good job for him in the future. // QUOTES: Interviewee:	Um, I wanted ... Part of it was the in-state tuition. In Ohio, it's pretty good. I mean not- That's a big part of the decision, but I wanted to go to a big school. I applied to Kent, [UMC 00:00:49], Ohio State, um ... Those were kind of the three I was like, looking at. // Interviewee:	Um, I actually wrote a paper on this. Um, so, I think online education is really, really cool. I think it's interesting. I think, like, especially for people who can't afford education, I think it's like, a really good alternative and a solution. I don't think you can do classes like chemistry or calculus or like, really tough classes online. But I think and online, like GE to archeology or something like that // Interviewee:	I think everyone is very concerned with just their GPA, and like, you know, especially if they're trying to apply to, like, professional school or like, their major, whatever. I think everyone's very concerned with that. Um, not a lot of people, like we have a little ... a fair amount of crime recently here, like, um ... That's somewhat a concern, but I wouldn't say that's too much a concern if you're on campus.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um. Ah. Just, I think, just getting jobs, like, I don't know, just getting a job out of college and not, like, wasting, you know, your tuition for nothing, you know. // I- I mean, y- Honestly, you don't go to college unless your goal is to get a job. I hate to say that, but like ... Y- Like, it would be a waste. Like, it would be a waste of money, it'd be a waste of time if you just went to college to not get anything out of it. So yes, like, it's to get a job. And then to study a particular area in depth. I think that is more true for, like, graduate school for stuff like that, because like, undergrad, you have- you have a ton of people studying in your area. It's not like, in depth. It's not like, you kind of get the basics of your area. // Interviewee:	That's why you go into a field that won't disappear in the future. I mean, I hate saying that, but I'm not going to college to study, like, a liberal arts type thing. Because I just know that they're ... That'd be a waste of $100,000 or whatever, because I don't think I'd get a job in that. Um. And, I don't know, I- my beliefs for this are pretty, like, one sided.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	But like, I just think like, like, monetarily speaking, like, you're not going to pay 20 to $40,000 a year to not go into a field that has something. Like, and that's why I think the STEM fields are so important that we, like, emphasize that, because those are the jobs of the future. Business, that's the job of, like, dude, everyone's got a business. There's always going to be STEM stuff. There's always going to be education. Things like that, like ... But like, when you go in to things like ... Like, I don't know, just things you don't necessarily need in the world. I mean, I- there are people that like to study it, but like, yeah, like you can't get a job with some of that stuff.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	So I don't think it's necessary for like a college to have that. Like, put their resources, like, into that. // Interviewee:	Um, we have a liberal arts education or whatever, so that's like ... And I understand that, but like, uh, I d- like just- just like, degrees that don't necessary like, matter. Like, like a dance major. Like, you don't go to college to be a dance major and then expect to be like, making enough money to pay off your debt. And like, just like, things like that. Like those degrees that like, necessarily like, don't benefit you, um, in the long run. They might be interesting, but if you don't have a job, like, I think like it's kind of a waste of resources to go to that. //Interviewee:	I mean, at least knowing my parents. Like, I ... I think, like my mom like, and my dad, like ... They obviously want me to go to college, like, they want me to go for the experience. And that's kind of like the ... To gain, like, perspectives on people, knowledge, and the world. But they also want me to go there so I can have a job, a future. I can pay off my debt. You know. Whatever. Um.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	Because it- it would be a waste- it would be a waste to my parents to like, take all these loans and everything and say ""Okay, go study basket weaving."" You know, like ...    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	They're going to be like ""Okay,"" like now, like ... Goes ... They want me to choose what I want to do, but they also want me to pay off my loans and everything because they can't do that themselves. So yeah. // Interviewer:	Cool.

And I needed to have a school with a fair level. // The pro of commuting, if you do think that you can make a lot of your own meals unless you have a dorm and you don't want to cook a lot because it's always very expensive to get any food around there unless you have, you know, the meal plan. // So you gotta understand it's your money that's coming out of your pocket unless you got parents paying for it. But you want to make the most out of that money you're spending. You're investing it, and you want to make a good interest rate. I think about that bank account. // They believe that the kids who have jobs in high school or before high school isn't good enough job for them. Of course [inaudible 00:59:08] the kids can't get a good paying job yet until they graduate. But the thing was to get a job is very, very general statement. It could be any level. So I took a job as getting a job at a cashier grocery store, a low skill worker getting minimum wage, but they have a job already. So that's how I view it is. I also view it as a high paying ... See, that's the difference. I view the job that you get then as a job. I view your, your, um, life differently when you do it because you have a career. Your career is your living is the job after college. Your job is what you start as. Start job is your job.    Um, so in thinking about the rank order, if it had said, ""Getting a career,"" instead of getting a job, would you have ranked it higher?    Yes.    And where would you have ranked it?    I would have agreed with the parents, because getting a career is very ... Actually I would rank that number one, but the thing about that is you do have to be independent. So I'm still gonna put it as number two, getting a career, getting a living because yeah ... A job isn't really your living, a career is usually. Because your career is usually what you're hopefully gonna do. Like I remember in middle school and high school they had career day. They brought up, ""What are you guys like planning to do?""

It depends on what you want to do. Like, if you want to, you know, if you want to, like, I could have gone to trade school. I could have learned to be a welder or I could have learned to be an electrician, make, you know, $70,000 a year right out the gate, or I could have gone to school here and make about $32,000 right out of school and then, you know, have to work to get a higher salary, so. You know, it depends on what you want to do.   Interviewer:	And, and, for whom do you think it's important to go to college, and for whom wouldn't it be important to go to college?  Interviewee:	Well, I mean, I think it's important to go to school if it's been determined that you could succeed. You know, there are other people that, you know, don't really succeed in high school. I don't want say don't succeed. There are people that struggle in high school and don't do well and, you know, might not be great for college, so. You might as well just try to learn a skill or try to find a job or, you know, do anything else, you know. But if college is important to you and if you think you can succeed, you know, do well in school, then do it. But I would say that just depends on how seriously you take education, and even if you do take it seriously and you're not that good at it, then, you know, that's not a problem. You can definitely start a different sort of career path that will take you towards your own sort of happiness.  // Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). And what parts of your education do you think could be done through online or distance learning, or what would you say to someone that argues you can get a sufficient education completely through online courses?  Interviewee:	I think that there's definitely a, for some that there definitely could. Like, I could talk with you, I could talk with you all day about, like, one book, and we could have discussions about that, but if you're teaching someone biology, there's not really any debate there. Like, you could teach someone biology, economics, things of that nature. You know, I suppose you could do that. You could do that through online courses. I'm a big supporter of online courses, because, you know, if you don't have the money to pay for school or if you just want to indulge in something then why not.   //	Yeah, I think, I think I had some other problems. Like, there's a lot of things that I think students don't really get a say in, about like where money goes or, you know, like what buildings are going up. And I know, I know like, you know, it's not the president's job to listen to students. I know that. You know, we're going to be out of here anyway, but I think there are a lot of, like, a lot of things that just happen. Like without going through, like, student council or student government or, like, really just asking people like what do you think about this? Invariably just kind of like pisses people off, but I don't know. I think I'm making Kenyon sound worse out there than it actually is. I do love it here. // I'm not going to lie. I wanted that 50 dollar Amazon gift card, and I figured, you know, an hour of my time is definitely worth it. I've worked jobs that were $9.75 an hour or 12 bucks an hour, so why not.

(laughter) I already have problems sleeping sometimes, so. (laughter) Just anything that I know that I have to do, like in the morning or like a test the next day will sometimes keep me up at night, uh, just because I'm nervous about not doing well. But, you know, there were definitely times earlier in the semester where I wasn't hearing back from employers, I wasn't hearing back from, I didn't really know what I was going to do. Now I do have a job coming out of school, but there was, you know, like my parents were really getting on me, like you need to find a job that's right out of school. I'm like, well, there's no job fairs here. There's no recruiters that are coming here. There's very few on campus interviews that I can get.   	And yeah, I was really struggling. I really didn't know, like, where I was going to take myself because, you know, I knew I didn't want to teach. I wasn't going to work in certain fields.

But in a lot of cases there's a lot of uh, fancier things going in around Columbus right now.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	In the process of gentrification I guess. Um. And. Yeah. I'm not sure that's right for everyone, because like, I'm just not sure that's the best for everyone. I feel, I almost want to say that like, your program should decide if you stay on campus two years. Because, for some people, it's much more important to stay on campus, like the pre-med, I'd say, it's more important to be like, close to the libraries, close to your classes. But, I'd say for business, if they're going out more and they're going to class just to go to class, and get their degree most of the time, I'm not sure they need to, they need to live on campus and be required to.    Interviewer:	Okay.    Interviewee:	I know it's one of the things where more people pay in, the more they can have. But I think that creates a disadvantage for incoming students and also transfer students who would like to live here for a year.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	Because as of right now, Ohio State is denying, I believe, all transfer students housing unless they apply at the beginning of the fall, I think at the same timeline as other students.    Interviewer:	Oh okay.    Interviewee:	So as like incoming freshman like priority deadline is like October-November 1st, if you haven't applied to transfer by then, you will be explicitly denied housing. Even if you're coming from the community college just five minutes down the street.    Interviewer:	Right, okay.    Interviewee:	And, uh, even like, upperclassmen who want to stay on campus, a lot of them are getting booted out, and I know last year they ended up overbooking because my freshman class was so large. I think we were around 8500 on main campus and 15-16,000 total. And um, from what I've heard this class is even bigger, 10,000 on main campus, and uh, up to 9,000 more on branch campuses. So they are, it's, it's, you're pushing the upperclassmen out just to fulfill a two year living requirement that I don't feel everyone needs."" //  ""My academic advisor has been very useful as well.

Her family's socioeconomic status has clearly made a great impact on her outlook and experience in college. // QUOTES:    ""Interviewer:	Okay. Um, so why did you chose Queens over any other schools that you might have been considering?    Interviewee:	Um, Queens as a borough, or Cordozo as a high school, why did I chose that high school?    Interviewer:	Queens College, sorry, I should be more specific.    Interviewee:	Oh, sorry. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, there were a coupla factors really, um, money's a big factor. I didn't want to go somewhere, I think the idea of loans and the idea of graduating in debt was really, really scary to me, especially since, at the time I was 16, which was right around junior year when we were applying to college, my dad just lost his job that he had for 20 years in a pharmaceutical company. So, I mean, though my parents have tried to shelter me away from stuff like that and wouldn't let me, like, really be involved in discussing, well what are we gonna do, financially, stuff like that. You know my dreams of maybe going to, like, a college in California, like, that just kind of- like I never even expressed it to them, because I felt like I would be causing them so much more, like, pain or trouble than they were already going through at the time. And my mom had a hip surgery cuz she broke her hip, like it was- it was a crazy time.    "" // ""Interviewee:	Yeah. Hustlers, um, I think every single student I've met, whether they're involved at QC or not, they are doing things outside of school. Um, whether they have three different kinds of jobs and they could be- I mean, I could give myself an example, as an example, like, okay I tutor kids, I also do wine tastings because they- the pay is great.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	Um, I also, uh, work at, uh, I volunteer at a local organization [inaudible 00:13:01], and I also, uh, worked on a- a TV station to make a show. So I mean, I'm not, I mean, I know mine are kinda crazy, but there are people who are doing personal training while working at a dentists office but doing photography. I mean, mine are more media related, my friends at least, but they're- they're always doing something, it's not just school and home.    "" // ""Interviewer:	Right, gotcha. Um, so thinking more broadly, what would you say are your own goals for your college experience?

Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	To- cuz I had no- I woulda- I had no idea. Like I said, I got into college kind of like, this is the next step, I'm supposed to do this, education was kinda like, drilled into my brain since I was a kid. Um, like that education will be the only thing that will help me, you know, enrich my life and- and get out of the socioeconomic class that I'm in. My parents didn't say that in those words, but that's what they were implying. So to me it was kinda like, I don't know what I'm gonna do and how, but my professors kinda helped me hone that in, and- or the people I- the students I met who described what they were doing kinda helped me get an idea so for- for now I feel like for two and a half years I was like, oh man, I don't- I don't know what I'm doing, and then when I found out like, oh media, this, that, so right now my goal is, I feel like QC gave me the foundation of like, this is- this is- I'm forming myself as a person, I kin- I think I finally get where my ideas are and who I want to be, and what I want to be, but it's just a foundation.    "" // ""Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- yeah. Okay. So thinking a little bit more specifically about the curriculum at Queens College, if you could be made in charge of the academic program, if you could become the Czar, what are three ...    Interviewee:	Ugh, Cczar.    Interviewer:	... changes that you would want to make?    Interviewee:	Oh man, I would want to put more- it's a liberal col- it's a liberal arts college, right, so I would want to put way more classes that are- that are technical and also that are practical in- in life, like, you know, I don't know how many high school's had home economics but mine certainly didn't and I hear that's a dying subject.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	But it, it really shouldn't be because these are- I mean, where- where are you gonna learn these things, what if you don't have parents who truly understand how to work half those things, I- I think that, just- leaving that just to high school or middle school, I think that's not enough. Because in college you get closer and closer to being an adult, I mean, just think about the transition, in high school you had to ask permission to go to the bathroom, and then in college, oh hey, like, pay your tuition and- and figure things out and oh, chose your own classes and then what you're gonna major in so that you can go off into the adult world where all the jobs are, like ...    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	... that's just a crazy, I think that's a difficult transition, and I think that co- gives a lot of people anxiety, and if there were classes that kind of dealt with more, like, of the practical approach, not seminars, not- not things that you can voluntarily go to, I mean- I mean, make them a part of the curriculum, a part of the core. You know, I understand, like writing en- there's english classes where you learn how to formulate an essay, like, they revisit that stuff, and that's fine, but there should be classes that are more focused on practical things that you need to know in order to succeed in life ...    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	... because not everybody has access to that information. I know I certainly didn't. I know a lot of that I learned because I was blessed to have friends who had- had parents who kind of understand that stuff. E- even like taking out a loan, or just how the job life works, it's just, I don't know. It would be a- it would be more- more focused on that. Less on theory, more on- more on practical.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	Or- or- or better mixed, I should say, not less.    Interviewer:	Gotcha. Okay, so what do you think, um, maybe, should you get out of your course of study once you leave Queens? Do you think that there is anything that everyone should get out of a college education, like a specific area of knowledge that everyone should have? You may have just answered this but (laughs) ...    Interviewee:	Uh, yeah, yeah. So I- I do think that no matter what, uh, major you're in, uh, you're gonna need to know about resume writing and applying to jobs, right?    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	And, um, I- I think that, it's weird, I fe- I feel like, you know, you- there are- there is help at Queens College, I mean there are seminars and stuff like that. But I feel like there could be a whole class that someone could take that could just be about the professional industry and- and I think my business and liberal arts minor would kind of help me navigate through that, you know, just writing memos, cuz sometimes you might have to do that, regardless of what job you're in, um, or, uh, what's something else that we learned? Or just, my accounting class, checkbook balancing, you know, if that was a part of a- a core curriculum everyone had to take I think that would be very essential and helpful, because those are things we're gonna to do regardless of what field you're in.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	Um, so that- you know, I think also, it's- I don't know it's weird, what I've realized is for me, why I thought media and business were important event though they're separate, right, but, in terms of my major and minor, but if you're going into an industry you kin- like, especially media, you're gonna have to learn how to market and sell yourself in a way. You know, like, I- I- I feel like- I don't know, I feel like, just like how psychology, like there are certain thin- things that, certain human behaviors that you can identify that may help you in terms of socializing with someone or- or- or engaging in a- in a contract with someone that you might need to know in order- in how to- and come into the situation, and- or something like that, I don't know, I think they are ... I don't know if I'm making this clear.    Interviewer:	Yeah, you're making perfect sense to me, so (laughs).    Interviewee:	Yeah, like, i feel like there are certain things that are not common sense, like, uh, or co- or even being, uh, hired, you know, salary negotiations, those stuff, like, you know I know this because of my boyfriend. He's 27, he's a little older, and he's been out in the field, and his parents have kind of- you know, they're third generation Italian-Americans, and they've kind of told him, hey, like, you- you- you- if they're gonna pay you like this, you gotta step up and- and say something else.

Or my- oh no, forget it, let's just say third year of college and I get an internship, and it's unpaid.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	So you're saying that one more year of college, I'm gonna- I- that's when I'm- I'm gonna get paid, because that one year is gonna change my whole life, like, what one year is the reason why my work is gonna be validated enough to pay? And in certain industries, like the media industry, you- if you're gonna do PA work, which is, um, set work ...

Um, and there are certain industries where, when you're in college, that one year, you just have that one year, and then you'll get paid a little more, but it's like, I don't know if that makes this huge difference, um, to just not get paid at all.

Three to study a particular content area in depth, and four to learn to live independently.    Interviewer:	Okay. So can you just briefly walk me through your thought process, why you put them in that order?    Interviewee:	Um, I think- well I think it dep- for me, I've always, uh, before judging a person I would always wonder what they went through for them to act this way towards me or towards the world. I think I've always been that way so I think that's why to gain different perspec- and I think that college- I met people who were pregnant, I met people who were 40, I met people who were 60, I met people who were like, 17 and I- like a genius.

Number two to get a job because I feel like it's really hard out there (laughs) to get a job, um, salaries are not matching the cost of living, especially in New York City. Um, and I think that, like for instance my friend who wants to be a teacher, got a job- she didn't get a job at the high school she wanted to, but she got a job in HR for a college, and that's probably because she had a degree, and even though she majored in English.    "" // ""Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- okay. And then, so I mentioned earlier we're talking to other constituency groups, who do you think that groups like parents of students, or even faculty members would see this rank order question? Would it be similar or different from how you view it? And what would they m- say as maybe the most important reason to go to college?    Interviewee:	I think that really depends on where the faculty, and parents, grew up, and how they grew up. Um, I think that people who had the money and disposable income, they can view college more as, you know, perspective is important, you know, but I mean to live independently is important and I think that they're- I think, like- I think, sorry I can best explain this by an example. I had a conversation with the chair of the department, who I was trying to explain to him, I was like, well you know I- my mom had cancer and this and that and I just- I had to stay home to take care of the house because it was going to shit but, and just cook and stuff like that so it's hard for me to just go on and get another internship during this period of time in my life, and I don't know if taking a class, and I know it's a grad school- grad school class and I'm an undergrad and that's really cool, but taking a class on the, um, cult magic, I don't know if I could- if I could just give myself the rationale of taking a class like that, it feels luxurious almost ...    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	... to be that niche. And he said, well you know, in college you figure things out, you know I actually dropped out for a little bit, and I- because I went to Spain and I ended up living there for five years, and I looked at him like, I don't have that option.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-    Interviewee:	So for him it's- he was really like, you know, you'll figure it out, you- you'll have the time, and I'm like but- so I- I think that the socioeconomic background of those faculty and those parents really are important, because parents who are coming from an immigrant culture, or who are struggling they will- or- or not even immigrants, just regular parents who have been in America a while are struggling, they're gonna be like listen you gotta do it. This is important to get a job. You need to make money.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	And kids who don't have money to fall back on I think that to them they're gonna be like, to get a job. I want to get out of here, I wanna make better for myself. So I- yeah. I think you're gonna- I think the responses depend on the socioeconomic backgrounds of the people that you are questioning.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	But I think generally all of them will agree that college wilL help you in your- in- further in your life, regardless what the goal is.

Interviewee:	I think, um, the finances of a student are important to discuss finance, and also what has gone on personally in the lives of a student. Now I- I mean, I feel like there is some kind of common thread there. I mean everyone's gonna have their own individual experience right? But I think that those two things are really important. Those are these- these maybe controlled or maybe uncontrollable factors that affect a student in a way of changing their major. Maybe, like, you know that some may be interested in photography but are learning this because their parents said so, or they find out there will be more money, and I think- I think that those two things are really important to discuss that I think you may not have discussed as much or maybe you had?

To be able to do it on my own as much as possible. // Speaker 2:	Oh good I'm glad. Lets, um.    	So we've been talking about very positive things now I'm actually going to ask you, from your perspective, what are the biggest concerns about life on um, on your college campus?    Speaker 1:	I think one of the concerns that I'm concerned for... Almost all freshman I talk to, is the dining procedure. The whole dining procedure. Like, the marketplace. The food they have is all the same but you kind of pay so much balance that you don't want to miss it. So you go kind of because you have to go, even though you don't really like it. Um. And most people find it also that the food is not enough. And you don't have enough options, especially on East Campus.    	On West Campus there are some options but it's too expensive, and most of my friends are already out of their additional food points, which you can use for like lunches. Because you only have breakfast and dinners. And I think they can definitely change more things about it. Like maybe not, not make it, obligatory for everyone. Because it's kind of expensive and not very convenient and some people do actually prefer to cook, [inaudible 00:26:15] rather than go and eat. I like to cook for myself too, but I feel that it's already paid for so I feel bad skipping and buying other foods. // QUOTES: Speaker 1:	Just have fun. Find time for studies and also for different activities. Actually, I think I mentioned advice, Dukes tends to have more cultural experience. Because I think, they, most students don't have enough of that. They'll either study or maybe go to games, maybe go to clubs, go out to different parties and stuff but they don't have that much culture experience. There's so many free concerts. Free classical concerts. So many free movies even. Which I think is a really good way to relieve stress.    Speaker 2:	Yeah.    Speaker 1:	There's also many arts workshops.    Speaker 2:	Yeah.    Speaker 1:	Which I think is also very good opportunity. Like National Museum, has a different... Has major [inaudible 00:38:40] exhibitions often. So I think they can enrich themselves a lot if they try to attend, to learn about these things and try to attend them.    	Because I usually try to go, every Sunday there's um, there's a classical concert in the Baldwin Auditorium. Which is right here like, right next to us. I don't go every time. I just, I can just take my actually, if I have too much to do as homework, I can take it there and do homework because I think it's... Listening to classical music actually impacts... Actually benefits the way you study. You can learn things better. And, but what frustrates me is when I go there there's only about 20 people in the, in the whole um, um, like in the room. Speaker 2:	Yeah.    Speaker 1:	And only like five or six of them are Duke students.    Speaker 2:	Oh.    Speaker 1:	Which is, I think it's sad, honestly. And I think most people should... Maybe the problem is many people don't know about these concerts. Maybe they have to be more advertised. I don't know. But I think they can really get a lot out of these experiences.    Speaker 2:	And how did you actually first hear about it?    Speaker 1:	I was actually checking very often the Duke events page. Found some things I find interesting. They actually have many good things to global health or pre-med or pre-law, which is not my sphere. So I just skip that. But I'm always looking for free opportunities for different concerts because usually if you have to pay for it, it'll be like 50, 60 bucks. It's very expensive. And here there are some internationally renowned performers that come. And I like... I've been playing the piano for ten years while I was in high school. And I like to dance. So I like music, I like all sorts of music. And I think what classical music gives you, nothing else can give you. Like it can develop your intellectual thinking.// Speaker 1:	Um. I would say one of the main differences that, uh, in the US college is more like high school. The whole thing, the way the whole thing is structured. It's like you have your lecture but they're like going to regular classes, then you have homework after every class. In Bulgaria it's more like you go to uh, you can go to lectures but you can also skip lectures. Um. You don't have homework every time. You have like two main homeworks for the whole semester, and you have one main exam at the end of semester for which people are usually studying for like homework. They usually don't study that hard during the semester and really really study, study a lot at the end. Which I don't find a very good approach. I personally think I can actually learn more by continuously having to um, to practice at homework or with projects. And continuously having this um, we have many tests all the time. I find better, I guess.    	Also what I like in the US is that they have more resources to actually have practical ideas about what you're studying. In Bulgaria it's more theoretical studies. Here they have many labs, many workshops, and they actually give you access to the... They let you practice.    Speaker 2:	And what about um, do students in Bulgaria when they're attending university. Do they live in a dormitory type setting? Do they live on their own or do most students stay living at home?    Speaker 1:	Um. They can live how... Basically whichever they want to. Many students in Bulgaria go to the [inaudible 00:52:27] from smaller towns so they live either in dorms because it's cheaper. Or for people who find dorms not convenient or clean enough, they can lease, they can rent an apartment with friends. But most of them I think live in dorms so it's fairly similar. Where it's different is that it's a lot cheaper in Bulgaria than it is here. //"
LAS 0202,P163,School 1,High Importance,Seniors,"HIGH: RATIONALE: Finances come up often in this interview - both in terms of how they affect him and others. // QUOTES: Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative). And, uh, if you were to describe the students at BMCC in just one word or adjective, does anything come to mind?  Interviewee:	Diverse.  Interviewer:	Why diverse?  Interviewee:	Um, because it’s, (laughs), it’s a very diverse, many people come from, uh, different backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, uh, in terms of skill, ethnicity, uh, everything at BMCC, it’s very, very diverse. Uh, and it can be because of the price as well. Low-income, uh, individuals, individuals who already, uh, graduated, they already have a degree but they want to ingrain certain skills. For example, if you are marketing coordinator let’s say and you work, uh, in a company that, uh, uh, and you have to work with people who know a lot about technology.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And you want to ingrain some skills about coding. You can go to BMCC and take some courses then and they’re relatively cheap.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And that’s, and that’s one of the ways where you can meet, uh, a diverse background of people. // Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative). And are you heading to a four-year college?  Interviewee:	Oh, yes. Um, I’ve had invitations from … Because of my GPA, I had invitations from, uh, uh, Columbia University, NYU, but due to again my family comes from a, a country with, uh, financial crisis, uh, even though the scholarship, they do offer scholarships, it, it’s not enough. And I think I learned from my parents’ mistakes. I don’t, I don’t want to add into this debt. I don’t want to spend my life with debt. I think I just want more for me at this point. Uh, yes, to answer the question, (laughs), a little bit more direct. Uh, Baruch is my next choice as a school. // Interviewee:	Uh, attendance would be one thing.  Interviewer:	And what, what would you do with attendance?  Interviewee:	I’m sorry. The connection is a little bit-  Interviewer:	Uh, sorry. Um, thinking about attendance, what would the change you’d make be?  Interviewee:	Well, in America, it’s very strict in te-, in terms of attendance. And I understand, you know, it’s like work. You need to go there every day. You’d be, uh, pushing at what you do to be punctual.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And I agree with that. Yes, yes to all that, but I think that the minimum hours, uh, I don’t, I don’t remember the minimum hours you can, uh, lose, but if you don’t go to class, uh, for three days, that’s it. That’s it. There’s nothing else you can do. You can be the best student, but you're not going to pass the class because that’s the requirement. And, um, you know, things happen. Things do happen to many students. The, the trains in New York, they suck. They’re really, really bad. And for a student who goes to community college, you need to understand as the campus that they’re not financially, uh, advanced. They cannot, uh, most of us, we don’t have a car. We use transportation, so just, uh, the train. And the train is really bad.  	I come from Queens. I live in Queens right now, Jamaica. It takes me at least an hour and, uh, 35 minutes to get, uh, in campus. And the problem is that many times, I’ve faced a lot of problems and I have to wake up at 5:00 every morning just to guarantee that I’ll be there very, very early.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So just to make it a little bit more flexible, that, that would be fine. I’m not saying just miss every class and then you can go give an exam and then you're out.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	And, uh, (laughs), that’s not what I’m saying. That’s what’s happening in Greece right now. The students can miss the whole class and give an exam and pass. I wouldn’t say that. It’s important to be there. It’s important to be punctual, but I think there should be some, uh, some things that we can do to allow students to feel more comfortable, that they’re not going to, they’re not going to fail just because they didn’t go to a class, uh, three days.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	Because we need to keep in mind that, uh, because the campus is very diverse and because most of the people who, who are in this campus, they’re not as privileged as others, they have to work as well. Many of the students are mothers or fathers so they, they have two jobs and they just want to complete the degree. I have met people twice my, twice my age.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	We need to understand the requirements that these people have and the needs that they have and we need to complete that to satisfy them, to maximum. // Interviewee:	Well, I guess the, okay, so there is a, a dilemma here. Do you want to speak generally about the general student? I can be very specific. Because if, uh, because it all depends upon the needs of the person, of the individual. You know what I’m saying?  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	For example, if you lack, um, in finance, you, you should get, that should be the primary goal, you know, to get a job, but if you, your parent, uh, they, they have enough money to support you and, and the whole family and you don’t need that then it, how to pick something up. // Interviewee:	Well, I would give you my answer shortly, but before that, you need to understand the relationship I have with my parents and the relationship that every child will have their, with their parents and the parents’ perspective, right? My family comes from the financial crisis.  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).  Interviewee:	So the number one will be to get a job or be independent, right?  Interviewer:	Uh-huh (affirmative).

I didn't take my science classes till this year so I have to take two science classes my senior year.

Maybe I would feel differently about it, but yeah, I'm not intrigued to use it. If it was an economic thing, maybe. Yeah, if I can take this class for free.

Being an active participant in your classes is a contribution in terms of the intellectual. 'Cause that is obviously, that's a huge part, you're coming to take classes first and foremost.

I know what I do in my first job is not gonna be what I do for the rest of my life. So that is not the best measure of success. I think the measure success you come out having an idea of the direction that you wanna pursue and having a set of priorities that will guide your actions, guide the steps you take. So if I came out of college knowing my most important thing will be to make millions of dollars, then you know college my success is I'm going to try to go make millions of dollars for whatever period of time.

I guess it allows you to go to certain things going on on campus, but for me, at least the reason I moved back home was that I was paying for rent and I didn't feel that the social elements I was getting from living on campus were enough to justify the rent I was paying.// Like, I understand that sometimes there are jobs you can take that don't require a degree, but I think, I mean, ultimately, ultimately, you put the odds strongly in your favor. You kind of leveled the playing field with so many other people.

Um, losing my house. I mean, losing my family home the first semester really affected, um, how I viewed College. Um, I stopped viewing as, like, that enthusiastic ""Oh, this is going to be the best four years of your life,"" as, like, a tool."" ""I kind of wanna ...

Interviewee:	Mm, yeah I think that obviously the cost is kind of ridiculous, but a lot of studies have shown that it has huge impacts in terms of later life, like, how much money you make in jobs later in life, from a purely economic perspective.

I mean, I feel like anywhere you come from, unless it's like top undergraduate ... or top high school program in the nation where you're paying like 40 thousand dollars a year for your tuition, you're gonna come in if you're from like a public school or a small private school like mine, you're gonna come in and sort of be equipped, but you really have to make a commitment to succeed"" // ""Interviewer:	Right, okay. So what was it about the dorms that were not appealing to you?    Interviewee:	They're expensive. The meal plan is not very good. My largest expense was my freshman year here at Ohio State. It's really unfortunate too. You know, you come to this university, and like, it's a state school. You get a good education. But now they're requiring students that come into Ohio State to pay two years of the meal plan and of housing and live two years on campus. They're trying to market it like it's a benefit to students, but I really think it's just a money, like a money scheme, and they're ... yeah. It's really not ... It's not [inaudible 00:25:10] cracked up to be. Because, you know, not everyone's gonna succeed in that environment where they're constantly around their peers.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	So, for me, I also was like that. I value my alone time, my personal time, and I also value, um, the cost of not living in the 20 thousand dollar new dorm that isn't worth it."" // ""Interviewer:	Um, okay. So then on the ... on the opposite side, from your perspective, what are some of the biggest problems or concerns on Ohio State's campus?    Interviewee:	Uh, from my perspective?    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	I think that one of their biggest problems is housing. Again, I think that two year living requirement is gonna gentrify and also make it very difficult for college students from Ohio. Ohio is actually in a really unique spot right now. So the average ACT for students coming in was like a 30, I think, or something like that. So now we're getting at levels where we're attracting students that are, are looking at Ivy League schools, right? But we're a state school in Ohio. So it's a ... And we want to serve the state.    	So Ohio State actually has a lot of branch campuses around Ohio. And it's kind of unfortunate if you're a student from Ohio, it's becoming so difficult not to come into the main campus despite being from Ohio. They're sending a lot of students from my area, especially, and other areas, to these regional campuses, which, you know, it's not bad in the long run cause you can transfer after like a year or two years. But it does sort of have a stigma to it or like it's not like exactly what students want to hear, you know.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Um, so that ... I think that's a really big issue is figuring out how academically savvy we want our incoming classes to be and what kind of school we're trying to like go to ... or become. The second issue I think is, you know ... I talked about the housing too, so I think that was an issue, the two year housing. Gentrifying the area is definitely occurring."" // ""Interviewer:	Right. Okay. So when you see or talk to some of your friends who don't go to Ohio State, do you notice any differences in the way that their experiences have changed them and how your experiences here have made a difference for you? Do you notice any distinctions?    Interviewee:	I noticed some differences. Um, biggest factor in that though is money. Some small private institutions or colleges, you know, the way they're set up is like very different than Ohio State. Ohio State's much more of a regular, laid back community. So a good example is like Miami of Ohio, the university here. It's very expensive to go to, and a lot of wealthy individuals go there. And because of that the culture is very different than Ohio State. It's a good university nonetheless, but I think our experiences are different just because the factor or how influential money can be in those situations.    	Whereas Ohio State, it's still to this point a state school where, you know, students from all ranges of income come to this university and can succeed and can have fun. So, but they all build a part of that community here. And because of the difference between money between Miami and Ohio State, you get that difference experience and different feel from students."" // ""Interviewer:	Okay. Um, so if you could then advise an incoming freshman student, what would be three pieces of advice you would give them that would help them make the most of their experience?    Interviewee:	I actually did this like last lecture with Dr. Foose. Sorry, you probably don't know him. With like a chemistry professor of mine and he always tries to like impart a little bit of wisdom to the freshmen that he taught for the last semester. Right? And going into their sophomore year. And I was like ... He asked me to do it this year with him. So I guess the one ... The three pieces of advice if I were to give them is one, commit to your education and like cut all the crap. Right?    Interviewer:	Uh-huh.    Interviewee:	Cause especially your freshman year, like, there's so many distractions coming to a new campus. And a campus like Ohio State where there's literally everything going on.    Interviewer:	Yeah.    Interviewee:	It's hard to find that niche that you're going to fit into, and then succeed in. So because of that I feel like students sometimes get caught up in it and they'll struggle their freshman year. I was the exact same way. The second one is to like avoid comparisons and like really focus on your overall wellbeing. Um, so you know, your freshman year you come in and you've been told, or here at Ohio State, right? If you are on the main campus it basically means you're in the top 25% of your class from wherever you're at. So it means you're academically savvy and you've done well throughout your high school education. Well there is a ... There's a learning gap between college ... or your freshman year in college that students have to experience. Right?    	And unfortunately what happens, right, is students will come, not be ready for it, but some will. And, you know, they'll start comparison ... comparing themselves with their peers at this point, right, the first time that they have peers to some people.    Interviewer:	Right.    Interviewee:	And because this is the first time they have peers ever in their lives ... Right? They don't know how to handle too, and they can start having these negative thoughts and like really negative emotions that are occurring, right, such as jealously or like, you know, envy, or maybe they're like feeling useless or like hopeless. Right? Because they're comparing themselves to their peers now. What I would emphasize, or what I think would be important was to tell students like you're at college now to learn and to be a better individual and to like master the material yourself. You shouldn't pay attention to what other people are doing at this time. You should really focus on yourself.    	In general chemistry, lab is actually one of the best places to watch this occur, because students like, you know, the really smart students from the best education in the country that have ... They probably paid like 60 thousand dollars to go to these private schools. They [inaudible 00:43:46] chemistry lab already, so they finish labs in ten minutes. And these other students will spend hours in this chemistry lab, and they'll see their peers leave and they're like, ""Well, am I dumb? Like what is going on? I can't ... "" And that's the first time, you know, that they've been in a situation like that."" // "

I know for other people, like, my other Premed friends, I think the classes at other schools are easier, like particularly Chemistry, um, and I think for the people who go to smaller schools, it's a little different for them because they don't have quite as many opportunities. Like OSU just has enough money pretty much to give us whatever.    Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).    Interviewee:	Whereas at other small schools, they maybe don't have that.

Why or why not?]  Um, I think it's depending on what you want to do. There are certain things you have to be educated about in a college way.

Um, but I think for some things, like, um, I don't know, I mean ... it's a good way to show that you understand material so you can, uh, you can ... you have, like evidence that you're qualified. So, I guess if there wasn't college, people ... there would be no way to prove you're qualified for such of a job. But, at the same, uh, sentence, if you can't afford college, um, or you're not going into a field where you really need to prove specific skills, uh, then I don't see it really viable.// OK. Um, I guess first off I would say the most important, uh, one would be getting a job. Um, certain um, jobs and applications just have uh ... force you to go to college. So, without college, there are certain jobs you can't get.    Um, simple as that.// They ... yeah, parents would definitely rank job #1. Um, because a lot of parents help their kids pay for it.

Um, cuz honestly, like if I didn't have to go to college for something, and I could be whoever I wanted to be, um, I wouldn't go, because I wouldn't have to walk out of college with so much debt. Um, and proly like a weakened mental health.    Um, so, I don't know. I guess I would just ask, why did you want to go to college?    And, uh, do you think it's like justified if you had the choice not to? Um, I guess for people who have to because of uh, being able to prove that they're qualified for certain jobs ... I mean like you can't say you can't go to college if you want to be something that's very specified, and uh ... but, um, I guess for some people um, you could ask like what's their major, what are they doing, and if they really want to go to college or not.//    "

And then how often do you work at that sort of student café-restaurant?  Interviewee:	Yes. So I work there two days a week. On Monday, Wednesday like for three and a half hours.   Interviewer:	Cool. So are you enjoying working on campus?  Interviewee:	Yeah. I like how I only have to work two days a week. I think if it was anymore I would probably be overwhelmed, but-  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	Do it so I have, like, some cash to spend now.  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	For last semester. // Interviewee:	Okay. Um, well let's see. So I think like number [inaudible 00:47:55], um, getting a job and gaining perspectives, 'cause getting a job is really important to make a lot of money and kind of be successful in life. But if you put that aside kind of I think gaining perspectives allows you to, um, just be more rounded as a person. And kind of not be so judgemental towards others because most of us grow up thinking the way that we grew up is like the normal way. And like that's kind of all we know to be true. But then you get to college and you see all these different people and their stories and you kind of see that like, they have their own version of normal as well.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)-  Interviewee:	And, um, you kind of just see that like, your way isn't always the right way and there are more ways, there are multiple ways to get to one perfect conclusion. So, I believe that's number 1. And then getting a job and working like, er, being independent. Well, I'm just gonna say getting a job is number 2, 'cause that's pretty important. And then I'm like, I would say independently, um, is probably the sec-, er, the third because it's really important like I feel like most of when we grow up with our parents we just kind of rely on them for everything. I know I still do. I'm like, ""Mom, will you make a doctor's appointment for me."" 'Cause I'm too lazy to call.  	But like, after college, I mean, moving out like when you're, in col-, not living with your parents anymore you're gonna have to like know how to do your taxes and all that, which I don't know. But I feel like that's what college is for, so, that's pretty important too. And then like, I think content area would be 4, just because you can get a job and not focus on something. Like I think getting a job is more important than focusing on something but it's also still important because college helps you kind of just like be an expertise within certain fields. But I think that you can be successful without being too specific, too specific in one field as well.  Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative)- Great. Um, so you ranked job as number 2. And all the people rank job high as 1 or 2 is on this list. What would you say if the job that students were training for were to disappear in the future?  Interviewee:	Um, I just, I just feel like, um, yeah, no. I'm like, personally, I want to be a psychotherapist and that doesn't make a lot of money but like, as long as I'm happy doing what I'm gonna do, like I'm gonna be content with. And so I feel like, if the job went away as long as like I could gain, like I put gaining perspectives as 1 'cause I feel like that's just essential in order to thrive anywhere in the world 'cause you kind of have to learn how to adapt and like, kind of um, adapt to the environment and people around you kind of, so. // Interviewee:	Um, I'm taking a Research Methods class right now for psychology and like I'm kind of learning how like people conduct all of these research studies and I am forced to kind of participate in three of them, er, in a certain, I have to get a certain amount of credits so it kind of comes up to like three studies and I did four last semester, and I have to do three and I've already done two. So I just, um, I kind of just, I wanted to see it from your perspective and I know like it's hard to, um, get people to participate and, um, so I kind of just wanted to help out. And also the $50 gift card-  Interviewer:	Yeah.  Interviewee:	Was a, influential.

I feel like that's a way for us to start becoming responsible about how we handle the money given to us and, um, making wise decisions, all that spending it on a need, or actually, or a want, when we don't need those certain stuff.

Which is why I chose QC. "" // ""Interviewee:	Um, the academic program that I'm in at Queens College right?  Interviewer:	Yeah, both academic program that you're in, and in general. Any changes you might make.  Interviewee:	I would definitely ... We have really bad advisors. So I know that many students have a really hard choosing their classes and registering for them. So I guess better advisors who actually care about the students. Maybe a coun, maybe a counselor because I know a lot of college students go through depression. And the last, oh I don't know if I, if I should say this but, Metro Cards.  Interviewer:	Yeah?  Interviewee:	Yeah.   Interviewer:	So what do you mean by that? So that the school would-  Interviewee:	Well I mean commuting is expensive. And there are many students who can't, there are few students on campus that I know who just can't afford to spend so much money on transportation. Mainly because they have to pay for their books, and their tuition, and their food too.  "" // ""So I chose, yeah I numbered them this way cause um, I, I want ... I love to write. And I want to be an author. So, I think gaining a different perspective on people, knowledge, and the world is definitely a huge thing for me. Because the more I understand, or the more I know, it's gonna be better for me when I'm writing my book. Um, to have a job, money. I don't, I think money is a huge deal. Without money, there's nothing you can do. You can't really hang out with your friends, you can't go out. Money isn't everything, but you know it's something.""  // ""Interviewer:	Yeah, okay. Alright great. Um, and I mentioned at the beginning of the interview. That we're talking to some other groups as well. So how do you think that different groups might have answered this question, if they were asked the ranking order.

Interviewee:	Uh, I definitely think the student's would have chosen to get a job at [inaudible 00:41:30].  Interviewer:	That students would choose that for number one?  Interviewee:	Yeah. To get a job.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative). Why do you think-  Interviewee:	Mainly because, well I think we're living in a society where dreams don't matter. No one really cares about what you really want to do. The only thing they want to know is, so how much are you planning to make this year. How are you gonna be able to support yourself. When are you gonna move out? It's all about the job, it's all about money. There's no such thing as, ""So what do you really want to do? What do you want to do so much that you don't care how shitty your life is gonna be."" It's not, but I'm pretty sure that's why many people have chosen a job, as for their parents too.   Interviewer:	Mm-hmm (affirmative).  Interviewee:	I'm [inaudible 00:42:14] chosen to get a job too, cause I know that in New York City, a lot of kids live with their parents because rent is so expensive. So I don't think, learning to live independently would have been the number one. But I think they want their kids to get jobs so that they can be independent one day, and be happy and make money.

She seems to attach the cost of college very closely to what you get out of it, during and afterwards. // QUOTES: when she got her acceptance, she also found that she had a scholarship. It was a nice surprise. Her decision was not just about a money, but she is one of four kids. Most of her siblings are in college and DePaul is more expensive than Madison. // [College is] not about spending a lot of money. However, you should know what you want to do, know your career path. If you don’t, maybe stick with something less expensive. // I mean a lot of people didn't have any responsibilities in high school but then like in college like you're paying every second you're here is like money like you're literally paying to be here so like, kind of gives you more of like a reason to like get involved and to make the most out of college while you have ... while you're paying for it you know // I think that in the sense like if someone's like passionate about something and they go to college and they're like ""I want to be an artist."" But I also think that like in the job market like ""We don't need any artists. Like I should just do accounting cuz like that's where the money's at."" Like, I think that's a bad way of thinking. Like i think that people shouldn't lose their passions or themselves and like, and like, the search to like make money out of college. like there's, there is definitely a way to incorporate your talents and your skills that you're passionate about into a job that will pay off. // #1 is, I think realistically um, to get a job. Like that's kind of the end goal. Like, you want to be safe and secure. It's like, a grown-up and like be able to support a family and like, do all the things you want to do and like, it's hard to do that without money. And [inaudible 00:17:58] job comes money. So I think that money is the most important thing. // you're paying, you're using ... but like, you're not like ... you're only ... you're not only paying like a professor to like talk at you and to like teach you stuff, but you're ... you're paying to like, be in a community of other people the same age as you and to, you know like, create like knowledge, like to be in like a ... like a new city to be like, on your own, and to like learn more about yourself and like without like being like in your parents house. You know what I mean? Like, it's like gaining perspectives on those type of things. // I think that um, at the end of the day you're paying a lot of money to go to college so, it'll pay off eventually. And the pay off eventually means like get a job that will eventually earn enough money that you could kind of like break even, or you know what I mean? Like, that's like kind of the whole point of college, like, that's why it's so expensive so like you can get like a nice job that'll pay for it eventually. // I mean like, a lot of times (parents are) helping pay for it and they want to make sure that they're really practical people. And so, studying something in depth would be ... I mean, like, clearly the first one. Second one to study something in depth is like, like why we're in a college, like why you specialize in stuff. And to live independently, they're probably like ""get out of my house!"" Like, ""I'm tired of you here."" Or they want ... they don't want you to be dependent off of them. They want you to like, be self sufficient. And then like fourth because like, they're paying so much money for like an education and I think in their mindset's they would want you to still learn perspectives and stuff but like, it's not the most important thing. Cuz I guess you could theoretically do that while still living in your parent's house, like, just like gotta walk outside and try new things. But like, more so obviously in college."

Repeatedly talked of how college was overpriced and talked about the debt of his two sisters. He wants to be an RA later on b/c that will help with the financial aspect. //      QUOTES: Q:  Absolutely. Did you apply to any other schools or did you consider any other schools?    A:  Yeah, I applied to Plymouth, SNHU, Southern New Hampshire University, and I think, oh, what was it, I can’t remember – it’s a really good engineering school. Crap. I can’t remember. But I got into all of them, and SNHU gave me about $2,000 for financial aid.    Q:  Nice. And you still picked UNH?    A:  Yeah, even, like, with the math, it was still like $8,000 more than UNH still. Even if when I consider I would be out-of-state, but I wasn’t, so I was, like, SNHU is pretty expensive.    Q:  Eight-thousand more a year?    A:  Hm hmm.    Q:  That’s significant over four years, isn’t it? So, when you were making the decision, was that primarily sort of the tipping point?    A:  No, but I really, really liked UNH. It was kind of like my dream school.  //  Q:  So, what made it your dream school?    A:  It’s just like the perfect area and everything, and it had, like, the five-year accounting program and everything, for the master’s.    Q:  I don’t know what that is.    A:  Oh, it’s like, instead of taking, like, six years for your master’s, it only takes five.    Q:  That’s great. So it’s like a plus-one year?    A:  You get your bachelor’s in the four years and then the accounting master’s in your fifth.    Q:  That’s great. Is that the program that you’re in?    A:  I’m going to go into. I’m going to do some research. I don’t know if I have to do anything really, really special for it yet.    Q:  So, in five years you’ll have your bachelor’s and your master’s and be ready to go – fantastic.    A:  Hm hmm. Yeah, one of my family members works at like a firm, whatever, and he said once I graduate I just talk to him and I’ll probably have a job. And I was considering – I’m sorry, am I going too fast?    Q:  No, go ahead.    A:  I was considering not doing the master’s, because it would be, like, another year of expenses and everything. My dad told me, he was just, like, “Difference between a bachelor’s and a master’s is so much that that one year-span will be made up in, like, the first six months or year you get out of college.”    Q:  That’s really accurate advice, isn’t it?    A:  Yeah, my dad’s pretty good about that stuff.    Q:  So, being on the job market, especially in the climate that we have now, so that makes sense.    A:  It’s a pretty good consideration.    Q:  Let me write that down, because it’s an interesting point.     A:  So, once I realized that, I was just, like, I might as well go for it.    Q:  Yeah, it seems like –    A:  Because once I’m in college, I can just finish off --  Because my sister is going for a master’s while working, and it’s really hard for her, because she works, like, night shifts, where she – because she’s a nurse, she goes from, like, 8 at night until 8 in the morning or something insane, and then she has to write a paper. I don’t understand how she does it.    Q:  I don’t understand how she does it, either. So, certainly, sort of, if you were to stay here and do the plus-one, would you sort of just stay in student mode and not be working?    A:  Yeah, that’s kind of why I would stay in the student mode. I’ll probably get, like, a student, I’ll probably be an RA, that’s what I’m aiming to be. I’m aiming to be an RA around my junior on, so I can get the cut into room and board and stuff like that.    Q:  So, what is, so being an RA, what does that get you?    A:  I think there’s a tuition, the dining meal – meal deal, meal plan, yeah – I think you get free meal plan.    Q:  Oh, that’s awesome.    A:  So, it cuts it down by at least half, which my oldest sister did that and it saved her a ton of money. I think she just paid off her student loans. My other sister is probably going to be buried until she’s, like, 35 or something.    Q:  The one who’s the nurse?    A:  Yeah, she went to Boston College. Like, she should have been an RA, because it’s like $45,000 a year.    Q:  Is that how much it is?    A:  Yeah, because it’s a private school.  //  Q:  Do you think that it’s important that people go to college?    A:  I believe it is, but I think it’s overpriced. I’m not just saying that because, like, I have to take some student loans out. I’m saying that because within a few year period you have the debt of the equivalent of a small house.     Q:  I’ve never heard it phrased like that. You’re right, aren’t you?    A:  Yeah.    Q:  Within a few years’ period, you have the debt equivalent of a house.    A:  Of a small house.    Q:  Of a small house.    A:  Depending on the school you go to. My sister had, like, a medium-sized house.     Q:  The one who went to BC?    A:  Hm hmm.    Q:  Her house was a little bigger.    A:  Yeah. My other sister, who went to, like, a really cheap college, because she kind of didn’t do well in high school and was an RA, kind of like had the equivalent of a trailer home. Don’t tell her I said that.     Q:  What school did the other sister go to?    A:  UMass-Dartmouth.    Q:  Oh, good. How far is that from here?    A:  Well, here, it’s about six hours, I believe. But it was when we were in Rhode Island. It was only half an hour away, I believe. I was really young, I don’t remember. It wasn’t too far.    Q:  So between the RA-ing and the less expensive school, a trailer-sized – I like that. That’s a really cute analogy. A very effective analogy.  //  Q:  So, I’ve got this little ranking sheet here. I’m going to hand it over to you. And I’m just going to ask you to rank in order – 1 being most important – of why it’s important to go to college.     A:  I believe they’re all very important, but that’s just the way [00:19:37: I see it?].    Q:  So let’s talk through them. [side comment] So, most important, to get a job; second important, to study a particular content area in-depth. So, talk me through your logic.    A:  So, for the job one, I believe if you just get the solid job you can work your way up if you’re starting at the bottom or if you’re somewhere in the middle. So, getting a job is just the financial basis of everything. Like, technically, you could just not go to college and get a good job and still be able to provide for a family like you went to college. One of my friends is going to be a mechanic. And so, he’s able to provide for a very stable home.    Q:  And so, is he in a training program, like a mechanic’s training program?    A:  Well, he’s just been brought up around cars, and he’s been racing his entire life. But the colleges didn’t really seem like a necessity to him, because he is already getting paid, like, $20 an hour or something, because he’s just that good. So, I was, like, holy crap!    Q:  So he has sort of his financial security locked in without college?    A:  Yep, and he’s going to, like, keep working up, and it’s just something he loves. So that just seemed like, getting the job to pay for something is the number one priority; getting the job you love is number two, because the bills don’t really care if you’re happy or not.     Q:  And then I’ve got “learning to live independently” as number three; and “to gain a different perspective” as number four.    A:  Yep.    Q:  So, tell me about those two. Why is one more important than the other?    A:  Well, I think living independently is very important, because if you have been relying on your parents --  Like, everyone relies on their parents, but if you’ve been relying on them for absolutely everything, then this is going to change you. You could keep going home, but eventually you’re going to have to live on your own.     Q:  And what about number four?    A:  I think it’s the least important out of those four, because someone could be very stubborn and still be very effective at their job. Like, my girlfriend’s roommate hasn’t really changed – she changed a little bit since the starting of the year, but she still gets her homework done and everything, but she’s just stuck around some very, very certain things. Like, no one is allowed to touch her bed and everything. Like if you touch it, she freaks out and --  I bumped a pillow once and she, like, didn’t talk to me for four days. So, it’s like she can do really well in some subjects, but she also has, like, really huge weaknesses.   //  Q:  That makes sense. So, I’m going to move away and we’re going to talk about sort of transformation in college. And so, my next question is, in what ways do you think a college education or the experience you have during your time at college influenced your personal development?    A:  I think it kind of forces you to adapt, if you haven’t been doing that well in high school. There’s the certainty that you can pass or fail, and you just threw the money away. There is a possibility that they just won’t care, but it’s rare, if you just don’t do the work. I go out of my time to do the work or make sure it’s done. If I fall behind on my assignment, I understand why, because I just forgot or I just didn’t know about it, whereas, like, my girlfriend hasn’t really been doing that.    Q:  So what has she been doing?    A: She kind of just doesn’t do the work and then freaks out about it. She told me she had two essays for the weekend, and she did one, like, Friday, and then, like, Saturday I tried to, like, work, and I had her do work, but she kind of distracted me the entire time. And then come Sunday, like, around, like 9, when it was due, she had almost nothing.    Q:  So what did she do in that situation?    A:  She just handed in what she had, because I told her to, because it was due in 10 minutes. And she said it was worth 25 percent of her grade.    Q:  And so, how much did she end up handing in?    A:  She got a D on it, but it’s just, like, I don’t know. It’s just difficult because people need to start changing, otherwise they’re going to flunk.    Q:  And do you feel like, for example, that experience for her, and you prompting her at least to hand something in so she got a D, do you feel like she will change and grow from that?    A:  No.    Q:  No? Not at all.    A:  Some people are just so set in their ways that they need to be strongly punished --  I’m not saying I’m going to be the one to punish her. The punishment would be the one failing the class and the money going, did nothing, will be the realization, “I can’t do this, because I’m physically paying for this stuff.”    Q:  That makes sense. So, can she still pass the class with having gotten a D?    A:  That’s not the first time she’s done that.     Q:  So, she’s going to fail this class?    A:  I strongly believe she’s going to fail. And I am not proud of that fact. I try to help her, but I don’t understand how she’s going to pass the class when I’m pulling a C of a class I pass everything in. I’m just falling behind because it’s a hard class for me. I just sit there and I try to do the math in my head. I’m just, like, let’s say you get a D on a paper, that’s going to crush your grade. You need to pull a B and stuff on major assignments. Like, I failed an exam, and if I don’t pull like a 70 or above I might get a D in the class.    Q:  And is a D considered failing?    A:  Well, in my eyes, sort of --  Like, the fact that I’ve been pulling a B the entire semester and then just that one exam is going to, like, [00:48:35]. That sucks.    Q:  And technically, in terms of getting the credits towards graduation, what level do you not get credit for having taken a course?    A:  I think a C, or a D. But you can retake it the next semester, but it’s just, like physically my math one, I can take the final exam and pass. Because I’ve gotten an 85 on my first one, an 80 something on my second one, and a 99 on my third one. So I thought about it, I’m like, I physically could just skip my last exam and pass a class. Whereas my other one, if I don’t take it, if I don’t get above a C, I’m going to do pretty bad and stuff.    Q:  So you said you could take it the next semester, do you still have to pay for it the next semester or do you --?    A:  I don’t know. I think you can physically take it and pay, but if you miss it again you have to change majors or something.    Q:  Okay, so there are definite consequences?    A:  Yes.   //"
