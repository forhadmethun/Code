# Coursera
## Build Web Service With Spring
### Week 3
 - Spring Dependency Injection & Auto-wiring
    - Scenario: We want to use some Storage(AWS, Local, DB, etc.) but we don't wann corrupt our controller
    - Spring has annotation @Autowired that is given to some interface and a configuration class with @Configuration annotation contains @Bean of method which return the same implementation that would be used by the spring that concept is Depednency Injection
  - Spring Configuration Annotations
    - @ComponentScan can be used and point to some specific package to search for autowiried implementation and @EnableAutoConfiguration also used with the previous annotation to annotate the autowired instantiation
    - can be overhead as scan over and over again packages and subpackags
  - Spring Dependency Injection Code Walkthrough
  - Object to Database Mapping
    - object relation mapping
      - object to db
  - The Java Persistence API
    - JPA
    - @Entity
    - @Id
    - @GeneratedValue(strategy=...Type.AUTO)
      - JPA will automatically generate for us
  - Spring Repositories
    - extends CrudRepository<ClassName, Long>
    - we can write our own search query by methods findAll(), findByNameAndCategory()
  - SQL Injection
    - JPA removes all the concern about injection if we need to write code manually we need to take care of it
