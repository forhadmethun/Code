## Java ArrayList, Scalability - prerequisite, concepts - basic technologies

### Java Array from ArrayList
    list.toArray(); 
### Storage Scalability
 - no design is correct or wrong
 - good designs and bad designs

### Prerequisites
 - sql
 - nosql
 - concurrency
    - thread, lock, deadlock, sravation
 - networking 
    - udp, tcp, router, switch
 - file systems
 - OS
 - How database work
 - Caching

### basic Technologies
 - Replication 
 - Consistency 
    - storage system, more than one machine, data is same within cluster
 - Eventual consistency
    - eventually data will be consistent, at a certain time data might be temporarily inconsistent  
 - Availability
    - database, always respond to query(read, write)
 - partition tolerance
    - database, two nodes are up but cannot communicate, there is a partition
 - vertical scaling  & horizontal scaling
    - adding more resources to server( ram, cpu, storage)
    - example: restaurant, more popular so exceeding capacity. we can add more chair(vertical scaling) but as the space is limited so we won't be able to add more chairs when the space is full so another way is to open new branches of the restaurant(horizontal scaling)
 - sharding
    - in huge system data cannot fit in a machine
    - splitting large database into smaller, faster and more managebale parts


### CAP Theorem
 - In a distributed system it is impossible to simultaneously guarantee all of the following - 
    - consistency 
    - availability
    - partition tolerance
