- [x] system design: scaling aws
### Design system that scale to millions of users on AWS
#### Step 1: Use cases, Constraints, Assumption
gather information/ requirements, ask questions to clarify usecase, constraints and assumptions
- use case
  - iterative approach i) benchmark/load test ii) profile for bottleneck iii) address bottlenecks and tradeoffs iv) repeat
  - scope
    - user
      - make read or write request
    - service
      - discuss general scaling pattern 
- constraints and assumptions
  - assumptions
    - traffic not evenly distributed
    - relational database
    - scale from one to ten million user
      - 10 million user
      - 1 billion write
      - 100 billion read
      - 100: 1 read write
      - 1KB content per write
  - calculate usage
    - 1TB content per month
      - 1KB * 1 billion write
    - 2.5 million second per month
    - 400 request per second -> 1 billion request per month
#### Step 2: Create High level design

        |
        |
        web server
#### Step 3: Design Core components
    Use Case: user make read write request
    Goal:
        - with 1/2 users
        - vertical scaling
          - simply choose bigger box
          - keep eye on metrics
          - can be expensive
          - no redundancy/ failover
    Start:
        - Webserver on EC2
          - storage
          - mysql database
    Alternative;
        - horizontal scaling
    Start with SQL and think NoSQL:
        - discuss reason to use sql or nosql(tradeoff, alternative)
    Assign a public IP: 
        - ip doesn't change with reboot
        - helps with failover
    Use a DNS: 
        - map ip to domain
    Secure the webserver:
        - open only necessary ports
        - 80 for http
        - 443 for https
        - 22 for ssh only whitelisted ip
        - restrict server from outbound connection

#### Step 4: Scale the design

        |       |
        Sql     Object Storage

        Assumptions:
            benchmark/load tests and profiling pointing msql taking more space memory and cpu resources
            space running out as disk filling

            we can do vertical scaling but costly/expensive and doesn't allow independent scaling for the mysql database and webserver 
        Goals:
            - lighten load on single box 
              - store static content on separe box, Object storage
              - move mysql to seperate box
            - Disadvantage:
              - increase complexity
              - additional security
              - cost might increase

        Store Static Content Separetly:
            - managed object storge S3 can be used
              - highly scalable and reliable
              - server side encryption
            - move static content to s3
              - user files
              - js
              - css
              - images
              - videos

        Move Mysql to separate box:
            - consider RDS to manage MySQL ( Amazon relational database service)

        secure the system:
            - encrypt data in transit
            - use virtual private cloud
              - create public subnet for single web server so that it can send and receive traffic from internet
              - prevent outside access
              - whitelist

        Sql     Object Storage
        Master
        Slave

    

        Assumptions:
            benchmark/load test and profile show that single web server bottlenecks during peak hours, resulting in slow response and in come case donwtime. 
            as service matures we need more availability and redundancy
        Goals:
            - fixing scaling issues with web server
            - use horizontal scaling 
              - add load balancer like amazon's ELB or HAproxy
              - incase of configuring own load balancer set up active-active or active-passive
              - terminate ssl on load balancer to reduce computational load on backend servers and simplify certificate administration
              - using multiple web server spread over multiple availability zones
              - using multiple mysql instance in master-slave failover mode accross multiple availability zone to improve redundancy
            - separate webserver and application server
              - webserver work as reverse proxy
                - reverse proxy: a web server that centralizes internal services unfied to the public.
                  - request forwarded to a server that fulfil it before reverse proxy return server's response to the client 
                  - benefits:
                    - increased security
                    - increased scalability and felxibility
                    - ssl termination
                    - compression
                    - chaching
                    - static content
              - you can add application servers handling read apis while other handling write requests
              - applicaiton layer:
                - Separating out the web layer from the application layer (also known as platform layer) allows you to scale and configure both layers independently. Adding a new API results in adding application servers without necessarily adding additional web servers. 
            - move static content to content delivery network such as cloudfront to reduce load and latency

        Assumptions:
            - read heavy ( 100 : 1)
  
        Goals:
            - attemp to address scaling issues with MySQL 
              - benchmark/load testing and profiling address to take one or two of techniques
            - move followign data to memory cache such as Elasticache to reduce load and latency
              - frequenty accessed MySQl content
              - session data from web server
              - reading 1MB take 250 micro sec in cache where SSD takes 4x and disk space take 80x longer
            - add MySQL Read Replicas to reduce load to write master
            - add more Web Servers and Application Servers to improve responsiveness
        x Store Static Content Separetly:
        x Move Mysql to separate box:
        x secure the system:
        Add MySQL read replicas: 
            - in addition to adding and scaling a memory cache, mysql read replicas can also help relieve load on the MySQL Write Master 
            - Add logic to Web server to seperate out writes and reads
            - Add Load Balancers in front of MySQL Read Replicas (not included in the diagram)
            - most services are read heavy vs write heavy

            - continue monitoring
        Add autoscaling:
            - use AWS Autoscaling
            - set max min instances
            - trigger up & down
            - disadvantage:

        Assumptions:
            Benchmark/ Load testing & profiling are used to uncover new bottlenecks as service continues to grow
        Goals:
            - mysql grows too large
              - only limited time period data in db and rest to warehouse such as Redshift(1TB per molnth)
            - 40,000 read per second then scale Memory Cache
              - sql read replicas might have trouble handling cache misses we'll employ additional sql scaling pattern 
            - 400 write may be tough for single SQL write master-slave so need additional sql pattern
            - SQL scaling pattern
              - federation
              - sharding
              - denormalization
              - sql tuning
            - to further address the high read write requests we should consider NoSQL
            - Batch process or computation that do not need to be done realtime can be done asynchronously with queue and workers
              - example: photo upload, thumbnail generation
                - Queue: SQS
