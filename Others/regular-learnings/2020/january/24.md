### Design Pattern 
 - command
 - mediator
### Softawre Design -- OOP Design
 - UML
   - detailed semantics
   - extension
   - texual language: OCL(object constraint)
   - object is to assit Software Development
   - Modeling Language  
     - like: modeling circuit, modeling building prototype
     - standard notation
     - visualize, diagram
     - understandable client, user
     - software engineers insight
     - abstraction
   - UML Class Diagram
     - main symbols shown in class diagram
       - classes
       - associations(shown by line)
       - attributes(variable/ instance variable)
       - operations(method)
       - generalizations(inheritance)
     - classes
       - represented as box with the name of class
       - diagram may have attribute and operations
         - may be detailed: when we'll consider about detailed implementation
         - or may be not: in early stage
         - or we can also ignore unnecessary what we're not discussing
         - I need to choose what i want to show!! no variation in public, private or protected thingy
    - Association:
      - no symbol then one
      - * means 0 or one or many
      - 0,3 .. 8
      - 0 ..1
      - 1 .. *
      - means:
        - has a
        - belongs to
        - Is a Vs Has a
          - is a means generalization superclass subclass
      - avoid unnecessary one to one association
        - aggregate 
      - *association class:
        - sometimes attribute cannot be put either class so need middle class
        - captures relationship between two class
      - reflexive association   
        - class connect itself
      - Direction in association
        - typically remove arrows as more arrow more constraints
          - in later stage of development we'll introduce that as it will reduce some code
        - can be shown by arrow to some thing
        - Day --> Note
          - in a day I can take many notes
          - but a note cannot have day
    - Generalization
      - what is the criteria to break a superclass into subclass
      - the label is called discriminator
                Animal
                  |
                  |
                  |(habitat)
                  |
              ------------
              |         |
        AquaticAnimal   LandAnimal
      - when we're creating class we need to ask, do we really need the class
      - wen creating subclass we as ourselves - do we need this type of specialization, attributes or operation going to write in the subclass that differ from operation in superclass
      - don't break inheritance hierarchy too much detail level
      - only break whenever real important things when need to store that would be really used by people using the system so
      - When you are considering using inheritance, ask yourself whether the subclass really is a more specialized version of the superclass.
    - Object Diagram
      - name with colon and underline
 - Inheritance vs Composition
   - inheritance
     - is a
       - ex: car is vehicle
     - tightly  coupled
   - composition
     - has a
       - ex: human has heart
     - loosely coupled
 - Coupling
 - what is the function of super?
   - in java we can assure subclass method to call it's parent classe's inherited method with this special keyword

### OS  

 - Deadlock vs Stravation
   - stravation is any type of thread is waiting indefinitely
   - deadlock is a circular waiting condition that never resolves so a kind of stravation
     - deadlock is cyclic graph
     - hard to detect, because can happen once in a blue moon
     - deadlock occurs with multiple resources, it cannot happen without min two resources
     - some ordering can fix
   - dianing philosopher problem
     - 5 layer,5 chopstics
     - solution: never let the last lawer take chopstick if no hungry has two chopstics afterward
   - Deadlock detection algorithm
     - banker-s algorithm
   - 4 conditions for deadlock
     - mutual exclusion
     - hold and wait
     - no preemption
     - circular wait    
   - Physical Address
     - based on which physical address is assigned by the assembler, a single program has diferent binary format in their address space
     - a program can be loaded twice but each time assember gives new physical addresses
     - address may be assigned to phase in translating the program to in memory binary image
     - Dynamic libraries
     - Uniprogramming
       - no memory translation / protection
       - application run always in same meomory space  as one app at a time
     - Multiprogramming
       - without translation or protection
         - somhow protect overlap
       - with protection
         - base & limit fixed
       - *Address Translation
         - CPU working on virtual addresses and MMu working as physical address to fed to memory
         - two program can now think of starting from 0 address as both of their address space is going to be translated through address translation
         - translation is necessary for protection
         - simple base and bound
       - Based Bound
       - Addressing
         - Segmentation
           - each segment of code(heap, stack, code, data) has own segment in physical memory
           - Issue: Fragmentation
         - Paging
           - allocate physical memory into fixed size chunks(pages)
         - multi level translation
