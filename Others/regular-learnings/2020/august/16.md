## Jira
### Agile
 - divided work into small chunks, better visibility
 - raised visibility of task
 - task prioritization more clear
 - less downtime
 - improve teamwork
 - more predictability
#### Challenge 1: Tasks
 - more than 30 minutes and less than 3 days
#### Challenge 2: I'm waiting
 - A task that's long
   - Writing A Blog
#### Challenge 2: I'm waiting
 - Actually it's series of tasks
   - Write blog draft
   - Review blog draft
   - Revise blog draft 
#### Challenge 3: How Long?
 -  Story Points: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48  
 -  Story Point 'cheating'
    -  30 mints = 1 story point
    -  1h = 2 sp
    -  2h = 4 sp
    -  4h = 8 sp
    -  1day = 16 sp
    -  2day = 32 sp

#### Kanban vs Scrum
 - Subsets of Agile and two different types of Agie work
 - Scrum
   - Target deadline, fixed date to achieve some goal
     - release, deliverable
   - Timeline is more important
   - The quantity of work done is least important
 - Kanban
   - like scrum but don't have a target date that they are working toward
   - support & service teams that have list of work that always getting new items on it, prioritize and work as fast as they can  
   - no plan mode, no sprints
   - work from priotize list as fast as you can

#### Spring
 - Batch of work 
#### Backlog
    - two weeks delivery batch
    - initially  all issues in the backlog
    - create a list that team wants to do
    - not mandatorily to do now, it maybe in two years   

#### Epic
 - theme of work for that collection of work
 - sort's of works
   - Ex: Book to read, shows only the book related to book
