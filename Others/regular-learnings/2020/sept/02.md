### ** Idea from the instructor

Probably to narrow the business to a delivery company by road what connects cities within a country could be more reachable.

You can think that this company has a **certain amount of trucks and van what could use**, and has some **suppliers where it can rent the others** ?(how to manage in our system).

Then you can have also **management of drivers and other trucks cost ? (how to manage the costing)**, so that a **dashboard could provide the best choice to address deliveries** ? (what do you mean by this) in most cost effective manner.

You can consider the possibility to **deliver to some warehouse, some delivery boxes with code, or directly to final customer**.



- regarding the renting
```
    You can imagine as your supplier something like this:

    http://atrent.ee/en/van-rental/

    

    You can add 250 eur daily to that price for the driver and other 150 for an helper if needed.

    If there is needed for overnight you can add other 150 eur.

    

    To help data modeling on trucks you can some idea here:
