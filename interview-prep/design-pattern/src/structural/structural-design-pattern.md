# Structural Design Pattern
 - about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality
 - ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.
### Adapter
 - memory card reader is adapter while sending file memory to pc
 - power adapter where 3 legged plug connected to 2 leg
 - language interpreter person work as adapter
``` 

```
### Bridge
 - want to use multiple theme for multiple page in a website. what we can do? create multiple copy of page with different styling? or create theme class and let other class use that
``` 

```
### Composite*
  - Different type of employees of a company have few same properties(salary, dob, responsibility, etc.). This pattern let clients treat individual object uniform manner

### Decorator
 - PizzaDecorator?
 
 ``` 
Dynamically change behavior of an object at runtime 
```

### Facade
 - How computer works? magic or that simple? - just press the power button and this simple interface to complex subsystem is facade
 
 ```
Simplified interface to complex subsystem
``` 

### Flyweight
 - tea stall make more tea and save rest for other customer. Flyweight is all about sharing. 

### Proxy*
 - instead of access card there are multiple options for openning a door while the function of the door is to open/close but proxy is added to add some functionality 
 ``` 
class represent functionality of another class 
```
